It's comin' on, it's comin' on, it's comin' on, it's comin' on
Yeah, ha Ha HA!
Finally someone let me out a my cage
Now time for me is nothin' cuz I'm countin' no age
Naw I couldn't be there, now you shouldn't be scared
I'm good at repairs (s'all simple), and I'm under each snare
Intangible (aww dawg), bet you didn't think so I command you to
Panoramic view (you),
Look I'll make it all manageable
Pick and choose (hmph),
Sit and loose,
All you different crews.
Chicks and dudes,
So who you think is really kickin' tunes?
Picture you gettin down in tha picture tube,
Like you lit the fuse
You think it's fictional?
Mystical? maybe
Spiritual?
Hero who appears in you ta clear your view (yeah) but your too crazy

Foo Fighters,The Pretender,76,"Keep you in the dark
You know they all pretend
Keep you in the dark
And so it all began

Send in your skeletons
Sing as their bones go marching in again
They need you buried deep
The secrets that you keep are ever ready
Are you ready?

I'm finished making sense
Done pleading ignorance
That whole defense

Spinning infinity, boy
The wheel is spinning me
It's never-ending, never-ending
Same old story

What if I say I'm not like the others?
What if I say I'm not just another one of your plays?
You're the pretender
What if I say I will never surrender?

What if I say I'm not like the others?
What if I say I'm not just another one of your plays?
You're the pretender
What if I say that I'll never surrender?

It's paved, with miles of the unknown
Whatever seems to be your destination
Take life the way it comes, take life the way it is

Horizon in the distance
So close, and yet so far away
You shouldn't be surprised when on arrival
The dream has flown away
And fear is not here to stay

She always belonged to someone else

And wound up at your door
I've had you so many times but somehow
I want more
I don't mind spending everyday
Out on your corner in the pouring rain
Look for the girl with the broken smile
Ask her if she wants to stay awhile
And she will be loved
Tap on my window knock on my door
I want to make you feel beautiful
I know I tend to get so insecure
It doesn't matter anymore

Nothing seems as pretty as the past though
That Bloody Mary's lacking in Tabasco
Remember when you used to be a rascal?

Oh, the boy's a slag, the best you ever had
The best you ever had is just a memory
And those dreams weren't as daft as they seem
Aren't as daft as they seem, my love
When you dream them up

Flicking through a little book of sex tips
Remember when the boys were all electric?
Now when she's told she's gonna get it

Keeping all the memories behind
If you read the lines between the paint
Look beyond the cracks that store away
It's hidden in the windows of the walls
Right behind the eyes that saw it all

Now given all the facts of circumstance
I did not believe that a romance
Would show itself in all this dark and blue
That's the only place I ever knew
You put me outside my safety-zone
Outside all the lines that made my home
To find out that no one really lives
Without giving what it is you give

Through this field of trees

You are not gonna see them

My dirty hands, have I been in the wars?
The saddest thing that I'd ever seen
Were smokers outside the hospital doors

Someone turn me around
Can I start this again?

When it comes around, then it's taken away
Leaves me with the feeling that I feel the most
Feel it come to life when I see your ghost

Come down, don't you resist
You've such a delicate wrist
And if I give it a twist
Something to hold when I lose my grip

Will I find something in that?
So, give me just what I need
Another reason to bleed
One by one, hidden up my sleeve
One by one, hidden up my sleeve

So I took what's mine by eternal right
Took your soul out into the night

I am here for you if you'd only care

You touched my heart, you touched my soul
Changed my life and all my goals
And love is blind, and that I knew when
My heart was blinded by you

I've kissed your lips and held your head
Shared your dreams and shared your bed
I know you well, I know your smell
I've been addicted to you

Goodbye my lover
Goodbye my friend

You have been the one for me

Been afraid, always afraid

If I've got nowhere to go?
Searched for seas of gold
How come it's got so cold?

And how can I blame you
When it's me, I can't forgive?

Manic Street Preachers,Motorcycle Emptiness,39,"Culture sucks downwards
Itemize loathing and feed yourself smiles

Organize your safe tribal war
Hurt, maim, kill and enslave the ghetto

Each day living out a lie
Life sold cheaply forever, ever, ever

Under neon loneliness
Motorcycle emptiness
Under neon loneliness
Motorcycle emptiness

Life lies a slow suicide
Orthodox dreams and symbolic myths

One thing I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme
To explain in due time

All I know
Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away

It's so unreal
Didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Tryin' to hold on, did-didn't even know
I wasted it all just to watch you go

I kept everything inside and even though I tried
It all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually
Be a memory of a time when-

Noise is always loud
There are sirens all around and the streets are mean
If I can make it here, I can make it anywhere, that's what they say
Seein' my face in lights
Or my name in marquees found down on Broadway

The Fray,How to Save a Life,80,"Step one, you say, ""We need to talk""
He walks, you say, ""Sit down, it's just a talk""
He smiles politely back at you
You stare politely right on through

Some sort of window to your right
As he goes left, and you stay right
Between the lines of fear and blame
You begin to wonder why you came

Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

Let him know that you know best
'Cause after all, you do know best
Try to slip past his defense
Without granting innocence

Lay down a list of what is wrong
The things you've told him all along

Without your noose
You gave me something that I didn't have

Too strong to lose

Had a good-lookin' mama who never was around.

With them Indiana boys on them Indiana nights.

Well, she moved down here at the age of eighteen.
She blew the boys away, was more than they'd seen.
I was introduced and we both started groovin'.
I said, I dig you baby, but I got to keep movin' on.
Keep movin' on.

Last dance with Mary Jane, one more time to kill the pain.
I feel summer creepin' in and I'm tired of this town again.

Go write your message on the pavement
Burn so bright, I wonder what the wave meant
White heat is screaming in the jungle
Complete the motion if you stumble
Go ask the dust for any answers
Come back strong with 50 belly dancers

The world I love, the tears I drop
To be part of the wave, can't stop
Ever wonder if it's all for you?
The world I love, the trains I hop
To be part of the wave, can't stop

So smart, she's leading me to ozone

Children hurt, hear them cryin'

Or would you turn the other cheek?

One day we'll return here
When the Belfast Child sings again

As I look for you right through the crowd
All my life here I've spent

Sir will you help me get there as fast as I can?
Tomorrow might be too late

My love for life is gone you see
Am I fighting things I cannot see?
People always tellin' me, how sweet and simple life could be
They say, ""You might as well live before you die""

But one thing I know for sure
I am a danger to myself, how come?
Yeah one thing I know for sure
I need some guidance, to get me out of this hellhole
Jerusalem, can you help me find my way back to Jerusalem? Yeah

It took me quite some time to get into Jerusalem

After my blood turns into alcohol,
No, I just wanna hold ya.

Give a little time to me or burn this out,
We'll play hide and seek to turn this around,
All I want is the taste that your lips allow,
My, my, my, my, oh give me love,
My, my, my, my, oh give me love,
My, my, my, my, oh give me love,
My, my, my, my, give me love,

Give me love like never before,
'Cause lately I've been craving more,
And it's been a while but I still feel the same,
Maybe I should let you go,

You know I'll fight my corner,
And that tonight I'll call ya,
After my blood is drowning in alcohol,
No, I just wanna hold ya.

Give a little time to me or burn this out,

Hidden behind all these big rocks

I'm supposed to be locked up too
You escaped what I escaped
You'd be in Paris getting fucked up too

Got that Bob Barker suit game and Plinko in my style

There's an endless road to rediscover
Hey sister
Know that water's sweet, but blood is thicker
Oh, if the sky comes falling down

There's nothing in this world I wouldn't do

Hey sister
Do you still believe in love? I wonder
Oh, if the sky comes falling down

Got all these herbs don't mean a fucking thing
I'm a little witch, with the magick tricks
Mistrust the white house, come and get your fix

Crystals, rays of light, the taste of orange peel
Open the mind, change the mind, that's how we achieve
Can't hurt to try right?

Did you always want me to be something?
To mend a broken a heart
From a Devil of shallow nonsense
Turned your world upside down

What I ever said, did it mean something?
What I ever said, did it mean nothing?
And did I look the part?
When it's all said and done
When it's all said and done

I'm no good next to diamonds
When I'm too close, they start to fade
Are you angry with me now?
Are you angry 'cause I'm to blame?

In the city that we love
Grey clouds roll over the hills
Bringing darkness from above

Does it almost feel like nothing changed at all?
And if you close your eyes
Does it almost feel like you've been here before?
How am I gonna be an optimist about this?

Is a space that now you hold
Show me how to fight for now

And I can't help but stare

Ooh, I can't ever change without you
You reflect me, I love that about you

At least thats what people say (mhm 2x)
Thats what people say

But I keep cruising
Can't stop won't stop movin
Its like i got this music
In my mind saying its gonna be alright

Cause the players gonna play play play play play
And the haters gonna hate hate hate hate hate
Baby im just gonna shake shake shake shake shake
Shake it off! Shake it off!

Heartbreaker gonna break break break break break
And the fakers gonna fake fake fake fake fake
Baby im just gonna shake shake shake shake shake
Shake it off! Shake it off!

I never miss a beat
Im ligtning on my feet
And thats what they dont see (mhm)
Thats what they dont see (mhm)
Im dancing on my own (dancin on my own)
Ill make the moves up as i go (moves up as i go)

So don't worry yourself, worry yourself
The devil's right there, right there in the details
And you don't wanna hurt yourself, hurt yourself

Oh, no, no, no

Put your arms around somebody else
Don't punish yourself, punish yourself

And you don't wanna hurt yourself, hurt yourself

Breaking up comes at a cost
I know I'll miss this mistake
Every word I try to choose
Either way, I'm gonna lose
Can't take the ache from heartbreak

Oh, but as you walk away
You don't hear me say

Where's the good in goodbye?
Where's the nice in nice try?
Where's the us in trust gone?
Where's the soul in soldier on?
Now I'm the low in lonely
'Cause I don't own you only
I can take this mistake
But I can't take the ache from heartbreak
No, I can't take the ache from heartbreak

No matter how it falls apart
There's an art in breaking hearts
But there's no fair in farewell, no
And when I see you in the street
I pray to God you don't see
The silent hell in I wish you well

Old, but I'm not that old
Young, but I'm not that bold
And I don't think the world is sold
On just doing what we're told

I feel something so right
Doing the wrong thing
And I feel something so wrong
Doing the right thing
I couldn't lie, couldn't lie, couldn't lie
Everything that kills me makes me feel alive

Leonard Cohen,You Want It Darker,63,"If you are the dealer, I'm out of the game
If you are the healer, it means im broken and lame
If thine is the glory, then mine must be the shame
You want it darker
We kill the flame

Magnified, sanctified
Be the holy name
Vilified, crucified
In the human frame
A million candles burning
For the help that never came
You want it darker

Hineni, hineni
I'm ready, my Lord

There's a lover in the story
But the story's still the same

Elvis Presley,I Just Can't Help Believin',44,"I just can't help believin'
When she smiles up soft and gentle
With a trace of misty morning
And the promise of tomorrow in her eyes

I just can't help believin'
When she's lying close beside me
And my heart beats with the rhythm of her sighs

This time the girl is gonna stay
This time the girl is gonna stay
For more than just a day

Oh, I just can't help believin'
When she slips her hand in my hand
And it feels so small and helpless
And my fingers fold around it like a glove

I just can't help believin'

Made friends and lost them through the years

And I dress so viciously

I got bodyguards, I got two big cars

And movin' your body while you're sittin' in your seat
And then damn, you start doin' the freak

Then ya throw your hands high in the air
Ya rockin' to the rhythm, shake your derriere

A-come alive y'all, a-gimme what ya got
'Cause I'm guaranteed to make you rock
I said 1-2-3-4, tell me Wonder Mike what are you waitin' for?

I said a hip hop the hippie to the hippie
The hip hip hop, a you don't stop
The rockin' to the bang bang boogie say up jumped the boogie
To the rhythm of the boogity beat
Skiddlee beebop we rock a Scoobie-Doo
And guess what America we love you
Cause ya rock and ya roll with so much soul
You could rock till you're a hundred and one years old
I don't mean to brag i don't mean to boast
But we like hot butter on our breakfast toast
Rock it up baby bubba
Baby bubba to the boogie da bang bang da boogie
To the beat beat, its so unique
Come on everybody and dance to the beat

I said a hip hop the hippie the hippie
To the hip hip hop, a-you don't stop
Rock it out, pretty bubba to the boogity bang, bang,
The boogie to the boogity beat

I said I cant wait 'til the end of the week
When I'm rappin' to the rhythm of a groovy beat
And attempt to raise your body heat
Just blow your mind so that you can't speak
And do a thing but a-rock and shuffle your feet
And let it change up to a dance called the freak
And when you finally do come in to your rhythmic beat
Rest a little while so ya don't get weak
I know a man named Hank

Pain is on the way out now
Look away, a domino falls away

Knowing that tomorrow you'll be back again
Hang your head and let me in

So long

When I saw you in the distance, I knew that you'd be mine
Am I moving back in time?

Where all the biggest questions meet

Finds a sea-worn piece of glass
And sets it as a sapphire in her mind

Throwing both her arms around the world
The world that doesn't even know

Leaving only ash-filled ashtrays and the lipstick, unmade bed
The mirror, on reflection has climbed back upon the wall

You'd better take off your homburg

Freedom is just another word for nothing left to lose,
Nothing don't mean nothing honey if it ain't free, now now.

You know feeling good was good enough for me,
Good enough for me and my Bobby McGee.

Everything I want the world to be
Is now coming true especially for me
And the reason is clear
It's because you are here
You're the nearest thing to heaven that I've seen

In the living room the linen and the crystals
Sit all packed and set to go
I tell myself once more I won't be here this spring
To see my roses grow
And all the things you tried to fix
The roof still leaks the door still sticks

House for sale

Bee Gees,Nights On Broadway,53,"Here we are
In a room full of strangers
Standing in the dark
Where your eyes couldn't see me

Well, I had to follow you
Though you did not want me to
But that won't stop my lovin' you
I can't stay away

Blaming it all
On the nights on Broadway
Singing them love songs
Singing them straight-to-the-heart songs
Blaming it all
On the nights on Broadway
Singing them sweet sounds
To that crazy, crazy town

Now in my place
There are so many others
Standing in the line
How long will they stand between us

Janis Ian,At Seventeen - Remastered,48,"I learned the truth at seventeen
That love was meant for beauty queens
And high school girls with clear skinned smiles
Who married young and then retired

The valentines I never knew
The friday night charades of youth
Were spent on one more beautiful
At seventeen I learned the truth

And those of us with ravaged faces
Lacking in the social graces
Desperately remained at home
Inventing lovers on the phone

Who called to say come dance with me
And murmured vague obscenities
It isn't all it seems
At seventeen

Eagles,Take It to the Limit - 2013 Remaster,63,"All alone at the end of the evening
And the bright lights have faded to blue
I was thinking 'bout a woman who might loved me
And I never knew

You know I've always been a dreamer
Spent my life running 'round
And it's so hard to change
Can't seem to settle down

But the dreams I've seen lately
Keep on turning out and burning out
And turning out the same

So put me on a highway
And show me a sign
And take it to the limit
One more time

You can spend all your time making money
You can spend all your love making time
If it all fell to pieces tomorrow
Would you still be mine?

Where the old world shadows hang
Heavy in the air
She packed her hopes and dreams
Like a refugee
Just as her father came across the sea

She heard about a place people were smilin'
They spoke about the red man's way
And how they loved the land
And they came from everywhere
To the Great Divide
Seeking a place to stand
Or a place to hide

Down in the crowded bars
Out for a good time
Can't wait to tell you all
What it's like up there
And they called it paradise
I don't know why
Somebody laid the mountains low

Bob Dylan,Hurricane,69,"Pistol shots ring out in the barroom night
Enter Patty Valentine from the upper hall
She sees the bartender in a pool of blood
Cries out, ""My God, they've killed them all!""

Here comes the story of the Hurricane
The man the authorities came to blame
For somethin' that he never done
Put in a prison cell, but one time he could-a been
The champion of the world

Three bodies lyin' there does Patty see
And another man named Bello, movin' around mysteriously
""I didn't do it,"" he says, and he throws up his hands
""I was only robbin' the register, I hope you understand""

""I saw them leavin',"" he says, and he stops
""One of us had better call up the cops""
And so Patty calls the cops
And they arrive on the scene
With their red lights flashin' in the hot New Jersey night

Meanwhile, far away in another part of town
Rubin Carter and a couple of friends are drivin' around
Number one contender for the middleweight crown
Had no idea what kinda shit was about to go down

When a cop pulled him over to the side of the road
Just like the time before and the time before that
In Paterson that's just the way things go
If you're black you might as well not show up on the street
'Less you wanna draw the heat

Alfred Bello had a partner and he had a rap for the cops
Him and Arthur Dexter Bradley were just out prowlin' around
He said, ""I saw two men runnin' out, they looked like middleweights
They jumped into a white car with out-of-state plates""

And Miss Patty Valentine just nodded her head
Cop said, ""Wait a minute, boys, this one's not dead""

And the world can't erase his fantasies
Take a ride in the sky, on our ship fantasii
All your dreams will come true, right away
And we will live together, until the twelfth of never
Our voices will ring forever, as one
Every thought is a dream, rushing by in a stream,
Bringing life to our kingdom of doing
Take a ride in the sky, on our ship fantasii

If your life was bad to you
Just think what tomorrow will do

To get those crazy notions right out of your head""

I'm crying icicles instead of tears

In our old familiar place
You and I, face to face

A bottle of red, a bottle of white
It all depends upon your appetite
I'll meet you any time you want
In our Italian Restaurant.

Things are okay with me these days
Got a good job, got a good office
Got a new wife, got a new life
And the family's fine
We lost touch long ago
You lost weight I did not know
You could ever look so good after
So much time.

I remember those days hanging out
At the village green
Engineer boots, leather jackets
And tight blue jeans
Drop a dime in the box play the
Song about New Orleans
Cold beer, hot lights
My sweet romantic teenage nights

Brenda and Eddie were the
Popular steadys
And the king and the queen
Of the prom

Come out of the cupboard, you boys and girls

London calling, now don't look to us
Phony Beatlemania has bitten the dust
London calling, see we ain't got no swing
'Cept for the ring of that truncheon thing

The ice age is coming, the sun is zooming in
Meltdown expected, the wheat is growing thin
Engines stop running, but I have no fear
'Cause London is drowning and I live by the river

Supertramp,Goodbye Stranger - 2010 Remastered,66,"It was an early morning yesterday
I was up before the dawn
And I really have enjoyed my stay
But I must be moving on
Like a king without a castle, like a queen without a throne
I'm an early morning lover and I must be moving on

Now I believe in what you say
Is the undisputed truth
But I have to have things my own way
To keep me in my youth
Like a ship without an anchor, like a slave without a chain
Just the thought of those sweet ladies sends a shiver through my veins
And I will go on shining, shining like brand new
I'll never look behind me, my troubles will be few

Goodbye stranger, it's been nice
Hope you'll find your paradise
Tried to see your point of view
Hope your dreams will all come true
Goodbye, Mary, goodbye, Jane
Will we ever meet again?
Feel no sorrow, feel no shame
Come tomorrow, feel no pain

Sweet devotion (Goodbye, Mary)

It always turns out good
Everytime I've held you
I thought you understood

People say a love like ours
Will surely pass
But I know a love like ours
Will last and last

But maybe I was wrong, not knowing how our love should go
(How our love, how our love should go?)
But I wasn't wrong in knowing, how our love would grow
(How our love, how our love would grow?)

And everytime I think of you

Am I so lost in my sin
You ask me where did I fall

How will I find what is near
Don't question I'm not alone
Somehow I'll find my way home

My sun shall rise in the east
So shall my heart be at peace
And if you're asking me when
I'll say it starts at the end

Chipping around, kick my brains around the floor

I'm your private dancer
A dancer for money
And any old music will do

I wanna make a million dollars
I wanna live out by the sea
Have a husband and some children
Yeah, I guess I want a family

All the men come in these places
And the men are all the same
You don't look at their faces
And you don't ask their names

I'm your private dancer
A dancer for money

She'll get a hold on you, believe it
Like no other
Before you know it you'll be on your knees
She's an easy lover
She'll take your heart but you won't feel it
She's like no other
And I'm just trying to make you see
She's the kind of girl you dream of
Dream of keeping hold of
You'd better forget it
You'll never get it
She will play around and leave you
Leave you and deceive you
Better forget it
Oh, you'll regret it
No, you'll never change her, so leave it, leave it
Get out quick, 'cause seeing is believing
It's the only way
You'll ever know
She's an easy lover

And the children are creating
The other half ran away
Taking all the cash and leaving you with the lumber

Got a pain in the chest
Doctor's on strike
What you need is a rest
It's not easy, love
But you've got friends you can trust

Friends will be friends
When you're in need of love
They give you care and attention
Friends will be friends
When you're through with life and all hope is lost
Hold out your hand 'cause friends will be friends
Right 'til the end

Scratching and crawling along the floor to touch you
And just when it feels right you say you found someone to hold you
Does she like I do?

Baby tell me does she love you like the way I love you?
Does she stimulate you, attract and captivate you?
Tell me does she miss you, existing just to kiss you, like the way I do?
Tell me does she want you, infatuate and haunt you?
She know just how to shock you, electrify and rock you?
Does she inject you, seduce you and affect you like the way I do?
Like the way I do

There's a shoulder where death comes to cry
There's a lobby with nine hundred windows
There's a tree where the doves go to die
There's a piece that was torn from the morning
And it hangs in theGallery of Frost

Aey, aey, aey, aey
Take this waltz, take this waltz
Take this waltz with the clamp on its jaws

Oh I want you, I want you, I want you
On a chair with a dead magazine
In the cave at the tip of the lily
In some hallway where love's never been
On a bed where the moon has been sweating
In a cry filled with footsteps and sand

Aey, aey, aey, aey
Take this waltz, take this waltz
Take its broken waist in your hand

Now I stand accused of the things I've said

Love comes to town I'm gonna jump that train
When love comes to town I'm gonna catch that flame

Used to make love under a red sunset
I was making promises I was soon to forget

Got on a lucky one, came in 18 to one
I've got a feeling this year's for me and you
So, Happy Christmas, I love you, baby
I can see a better time when all our dreams come true

They've got cars big as bars, they've got rivers of gold
But the wind goes right through you, it's no place for the old
When you first took my hand on a cold Christmas Eve
You promised me Broadway was waiting for me

You smiled though you were suffering

Washed his hands and sealed his fate

Killed the Czar and his ministers
