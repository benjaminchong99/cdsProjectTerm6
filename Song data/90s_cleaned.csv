Did I always start the fight?

I grew up on the crime side, the New York Times side
Stayin' alive was no jive
At second hands, moms bounced on old men
So then we moved to Shaolin land
A young youth, yo rockin' the gold tooth, 'Lo goose
Only way, I begin to gee off was drug loot
And let's start it like this son, rollin' with this one
And that one, pullin' out gats for fun

But it was just the dream for the teen, who was a fiend
Started smokin' woolies at sixteen
And runnin' up in gates, and doin' hits for high stakes
Makin' my way on fire escapes
No question I would speed, for cracks and weed
The combination made my eyes bleed
No question I would flow off, and try to get the dough all
Stickin' up white boys in ball courts

My life got no better, same damn 'Lo sweater
Times is ruff and tuff like leather
Figured out I went the wrong route
So I got with a sick ass click and went all out
Catchin' keys from across seas
Rollin' in MPV's, every week we made forty G's
Yo nigga respect mine, or anger the tech nine

Or the vile and the nine; keep a smile like that
Leave the knife and the gun in the store

And just swing it
And party people, sing it

Flexin' just like a little ol' bitch all up in front of my company

Playing jazz you see
But jazz wasn't big around one A. D
So he got himself a job in the palace band
Where he heard about three kings
In the desert sand

Let me tell you children that at any time
Three kings in the desert that's a real rare find
Yes, it is

But Herod heard of it too
And when he heard his curiosity grew
So he asked those kings to drop by

'Cause I'm about to ruin
The image and the style that ya used to
I look funny
But yo I'm makin' money, see
So yo world I hope you're ready for me
Now gather round
I'm the new fool in town
And my sound's laid down by the Underground
I drink up all the Hennessey ya got on ya shelf
So just let me introduce myself
My name is Humpty, pronounced with a Umpty
Yo ladies, oh how I like to funk thee
And all the rappers in the top ten-please allow me to bump thee
I'm steppin' tall, y'all
And just like Humpty Dumpty
You're gonna fall when the stereos pump me
I like to rhyme, I like my beats funky
I'm spunky, I like my oatmeal lumpy
I'm sick wit dis, straight gangsta mack
But sometimes I get ridiculous
I'll eat up all your crackers and your licorice
Hey yo fat girl, c'mere-are ya ticklish
Yeah, I called ya fat
Look at me, I'm skinny
It never stopped me from gettin' busy
I'm a freak
I like the girls with the boom
I once got busy in a Burger King bathroom
I'm crazy
Allow me to amaze thee
They say I'm ugly but it just don't faze me
I'm still gettin' in the girls' pants
And I even got my own dance

The Humpty Dance is your chance to do the hump
Do the Humpty Hump

I don't wanna fall asleep
'Cause I'd miss you, baby
And I don't wanna miss a thing

'Cause even when I dream of you
The sweetest dream would never do
I'd still miss you, baby
And I don't wanna miss a thing

Lying close to you feeling your heart beating
And I'm wondering what you're dreaming,
Wondering if it's me you're seeing
Then I kiss your eyes and thank God we're together
And I just wanna stay with you
In this moment forever, forever and ever

To the ground
By the loneliest sound
That pounds from within
And it's pinning me down

From the emptiest stage
A cage or the heaviest cross ever made
A gauge of the deadliest trap ever laid

And I thank you
For bringing me here
For showing me home
For singing these tears

Lie and die in the fire where I learned to ball
Uptown is the place where I lay my dome
On the streets of the Bronx where my family roam

Hoe, damn it, we home, Peter got a nine millimeter
Playa haters can feel the flame from my heater
I never really liked to play a fool like that
But I love to succeed and see foes fall flat

Splat like Deja Vu
And I got another clip that'll daze y'all crew
I sip Cristal, Don P, Mo' with pistol
Just 'cause I'm pissy, don't mean you should mis doubt

Keep 'em near da fifties and hundreds all arranged
Anything less than that, you keep the change
Not filthy rich but bitch, I'm barely broke
Blessed with flows that keep you hooked like dope

Friends call me Gunz, sons call me Trife
'Cause I'm quick to slide off and slide this dick up in your wife
And that's life, you should learn how to treat her
I guarantee, Peter knows how to eat her and beat her

Niggaz in the Bronx call me Lex
'Cause I push a Lex and I rock a Rolex
And I lounge on Lex' and I love sex
And I wave techs on sets that be tryin' to flex
Like Dex, nigga, God rest your soul
But when you're playin' cards for Gunz, it ain't time to fold, hoe

New York niggaz got crazy game
But outta town niggaz is all the same
Brooklyn niggaz get crazy loot
That's because when it's beef, they ain't scared to shoot

Miami the bass and the sunset low
Everyday like a mardi gras, everybody party all day
No work all play, okay
So we sip a little something, lay to rest the spill
Me an Charlie at the bar runnin' up a high bill
Nothin' less than ill, when we dress to kill
Every time the ladies pass, they be like ""hi Will""
Can y'all feel me, all ages and races
Real sweet faces
Every different nation, Spanish, Hatian, Indian, Jamaican
Black, White, Cuban, and Asian
I only came for two days of playing
But every time I come I always wind up stayin'
This the type of town I could spend a few days in
Miami the city that keeps the roof blazin'

Party in the city where the heat is on
All night, on the beach till the break of dawn
""Welcome to Miami""
""Bienvenidos a Miami""
Bouncin' in the club where the heat is on
All night, on the beach till the break of dawn
I'm goin to Miami

Don't analyze

Wanna be impulsive
Reckless
And lose myself

Arrows through hearts
Drawn on a misty window
You're taking me home in the rain

My head keeps saying, ""Take it slow""

I gave, gave everything a man could ever need
I was there whenever you would call me, baby

I guess you're not the man that I once knew at all

How you walked away so easily, still remains a mystery to me
Don't you remember that you promised me?
Yes, you promised me that you'd never leave, boy
Now the love is gone, baby, tell me what went wrong?
How could you leave me hanging on? Oh, baby

Say your love is strong and true
Let her know all she meant to you
Show her she's that special one
Who shines in your eyes like the rising sun

Drinking a cup of punch, tropical

When I was sick Mary had tha hot soup boiling
Didn't know why but it felt so good
Like some waffles in that morning
Headed back to tha woods

Got some soul on blast in tha cassette
Food for my brain
I haven't stopped learning yet
Hot wings from Mo-Joes
Got my forehead sweating
Celery and blue cheese on my menu next

Southern Fry won't allow my body to lie still
Tied face goons surround me like cancer drill
Me with second-hand obstables
But, only to make matters worse
Plus I'm getting pimped by this temp lady Jackie
From Optima staffing figure laughing
Shut up clown don't talk to me

Took a hour just to get the car seat in right

Got you home safe, placed you in your basonette

That night I don't think one wink I slept
As I slipped out my bed, to your crib I crept
Touched your head gently, felt my heart melt
'Cause I know I loved you more than life itself

Then to my knees, and I begged the Lord please
Let me be a good daddy, all he needs
Love, knowledge, discipline too
I pledge my life to you

Salvation is his task
Stand by for Exciter
Salvation bids to ask

Everything he touches
Fries into a crisp,
Let him get close to you
So you're in his trip,
First you'll smoke and smoulder
Blister up and singe
When ignition hits you
The very soul of your being will cringe.

Fall to your knees and repent if you please

No matter what I try
When I get the courage up to love somebody new
It always falls apart 'cause they just can't compare to you

Your love won't release me, I'm bound under ball and chain
Reminiscing our love as I watch four seasons change

In comes the winter breeze that chills the air and drifts the snow
And I imagine kissing you under the mistletoe
When springtime makes its way here
Lilac blooms remind me of the scent of your perfume

When summer burns with heat, I always get the hots for you
Go skinny dipping in the ocean where we used to do

With levitation from reefers, drenching divas in E7

Casanova Brown levitating jiggy in dashikis
A la hotta car, 54, chasing diamond runners
Headed ice bound, the big chilla diamond convention
Harlem Buck Strut, freezing world heist, Hollywood
Madame Butterfly, let me in your house of pleasure
From the knuckle Swatch, shadowboxers catching black-eyed blues

I play the defe', what?
Sensations at the Mardi Gras be screaming Chee-ba
Fulfilling pleasures in my castles, blow the smoke out
The Garcia Vega substitutes when the Dutch is gone
The Lo don't stop, give me shouts
It's the seasoned sautéers, souffléers for swerving on corners
We magnets to moolah, living with Charlie's Angels on us
No smiling, we're sliding, that gets you caught up in the 'octor
Or deaded for moving, it's just like that as we proceed

Saturday night special, better take it light, you Jah Jah
You're a Capitan, quest to the coast of Key Largo
Wire the chain gang, keep your ears out for Roy Ayers
Sip the Fontainebleau, house of bamboo paradise

I said, thanks, people say that

In some tropical part of the world

Until the storm is lifted

Pop goes the, pop goes the windin' of the weasel
I see the empty pocket needs a refill
I got a squad with a list of complainers

It's ninety-one son, so somethin's gotta change

Gettin' paid to peddle sneakers and soda pop
(Pop pop pop)
Pop goes the weasel as drawers drop
(Drop drop drop)
Why not take your top ten pop hit
Fix the music and make senseless rhymes fit?

I guess it's the fact that you can't be artistic
Intricate raps, becomin' so simplistic
I gotta strong mind, it doesn't have to be spoon-fed
And I can read what doesn't have to be read
So some stay illiterate and feeble, legally licked
You go the ways of the weasel

Make way for a brother to make the first move
You're tryin' to act nice and sweet
'Cause I know that you is a freak
So let a brother lick them paws
And run the tongue on the g-string draws
And tease the kitty just a little
Then stick my pole in the middle
Before I hit, let me ask
Did the dogs done hit in the path
'Cause if they ain't got they shots
Then the kitty might not get got
They say it ain't got a bad bone

He had a Kenwood deck that was bumpin' loud as he stopped in a no-parking zone
The Devil stepped out with a beeper on his hip, a black Fila suit that was down
But then he turned his head when his eyes got red when he heard this scratchin' sound
He walked up on a boy on two turntables, this boy was rippin' the cut
So the Devil jumped up on the back of his truck and said, ""Boy, let me tell you what:
You rock the beat pretty good boy, but naw, it ain't nothin' new
Cause I'm in yo' town, 'bout to take that crown, and ain't nothin' that you can do!

Use the lessons that you've learned
Your goal is to be the best
And claim the prize that you've earned

You kept your eye on the master plan
To reach for the top and touch the sky
It's your destiny to spread your wings and fly

Bring us back to our senses

I realize that you've been hurt
Deeply, because I've been there
But regardless to who, what, why, when, and where
We are all precious in His sight
And a rose still and always will be a rose

Doo doo doo doo doo doo mmm
Dooby dooby doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo doo mmm

There was a rose I knew, I met her once or twice before
She was a pretty sweet thing, not the least bit insecure
Then you came with your slick game and played with her youth
Ashamed of the way you lied, played with the truth, hey, hey

Mmm, she never knew what hit her
Steal her honey, then forget her
Now the rose is scorned
She wears her thorns tryin' to forget about you

'Cause a rose is still a rose
Baby, girl, you're still a flower
He can't leave you and then take you

Love - come in a hurry
There are thieves in the temple 2night

They don't care where they kick
Just as long as they hurt U
There are thieves in the temple 2night

Love - if U're there come save me
From all this cold despair
I can hang when U're around
But I'll surely die if U're not there

I feel like they're looking 4 my soul (Soul)
Like a poor man looking for gold (Gold)
There are thieves in the temple 2night

But even if I wanted 2 I couldn't really truly cuz my only friend is U
Come on

She was so happy she just got married
I was on her cheek when she wiped me away with her glove
I could tell from the look on her face she didn't need me
So I drifted on down and caught me a ride to the sea.

The other tear said we've got a connection
I'm a tear of sorrow born of rejection
I'm from the sad brown eyes of her old flame
She told him they would be lifelong companions
Left him with questions and not any answers
I was on his cheek as he stood there calling her name

I spend wild chips gettin' drunk up in the China

I know she wit' it, I betta brick I could hit it
Black tie affair I gotta fresh pair of British
Ice Berg shirts wit' Ice along wit' it
Turquoise, 9-11 Porsche and it's tinted

You gotta bag, then she went inside the Prada bag
Blew two and she said it was choice, like my voice

Feeding on this youth's remains

Give me your innocence, give me the blood

While they kick back and just collect the wealth

He is a great emancipator

Some even say He's Emanuel, the Son of God

Never is and never was

The going can be real tough

You can keep your fancy bars
Clubby friends and fast cars
And when the going gets hard
You can eat your credit cards

I really tried to fight it
But what the hell I like it

There is always room at the top
Don't let them tell you that there is not
Made in England born and bred
An eighteenth century brain
In a twenty first century head

It's holding tight, lettin' go
It's flying high and lying low
Let your strongest feelings show
And your weakness, too

It's a little and a lot to ask
An endless and a welcome task
Love isn't something that we have

Can't get a job get drunk some more
You betta stop trippin on dem stereotypes
Cause in the ghetto there's a good life
We ain't starvin like Marvin, won't see no roach
When ya chill wit the rich folks in the hood
You're sittin on leather watchin big screens
Bought by the dope fiends
Smokin, and what about the brother wit the good jobs
Savin money, and workin hard
Bought a house for his wife and kids
Ya only got one life to live
Another brother got some cocaine
You know his face, but don't know his name
You know he got the sack mayn
And he's sittin on a fat bank
Seven cars at his house in the driveway
Benz so clean don't roll it just fly away
'Cause folks got money in the ghetto yeah you know

Hey hey hey whatcha got to say (There's money in the ghetto)
Hollywood! Havin money in the ghetto

Money in the ghetto ain't nothin new
It's been like that, way before you
Was even born, get up from the down stroke
Chocolate City for the black folks
Say it loud in ya hot pants
Man child in the promised land
I take you back to Iceberg Slim
And all the players that came before him
If you a everyday hustler, get your money

(Gloria Estefan)

I've been alone inside myself for far too long
Never really wanted it that way but I let it happen
If I could do it all again my life would be
Infinitely better than before I wouldn't waste a moment
(I'd) Make time for laughing with my friend
Make love, make music, make amends
Try to make a difference try to love, try to understand
Instead of just giving up I'd use the power at my command

'Cause there's Always Tomorrow to start over again
Things will never stay the same the only one sure thing
Is change
That's why there's Always Tomorrow

I guess it took a little time, for me to see
The reason I was born into this world and what I'd have
To go through.
For I've finally realized that I could be
Infinitely better than before definitely stronger
I'll face whatever comes my way
Savor each moment of the day
Love as many people as I can along the way.
Help somone who's giving up if it's just to raise
My eyes and pray.

Chorus

Before your last setting sun
And everything your heart has longed for
Has yet to be (one)

But if you've brought some love to their lives

Thinkin' 'bout back in the days, when the year was '89
Little nigga on the grind, gotta get mine, doin' my crime
With two in here, steady stackin' my ends
Put my serve down on the Clair 9-9
Hittin' up the Graveyard Shift with Real
Little Will, Big Wally, and Wish Bone
Little Wally High Rollerz, and he wonder why niggas so strong
Krayzie Bone, stack, Rod Jay, much love
Kept a nigga on his toes in the game
It's an everyday thang, when you let your nuts hang
Gotta make a grand at least daily, man
Them Cleveland hustlers, never no busters, thug to the heart
We niggas from the land fool, and the old school
Just serve out your sentence and be cool
Fuckin' with Trues, rest in peace
Little nigga RIPsta, stress that Bone love
Smokin' on bud, 'cause a nigga Mo Thug
Callin' up my niggas when it's time to nut up
In the 9-9, niggas gonna drop to the number one
With your gun, so run, run
Cleveland is the city where a nigga come from
Slangin' them dum-dums

Niggas it's goin' down, up in the C-Town
Get 'em up with the thug (thug) and that nigga with the bud (bud)
Get the fifth of Rose, but the liquor store closed and I'm all out the forty, raise up, nigga
Burn up the buddah, smoke it all up nigga, don't stiff on the reefer
Mo runnin' up outta the cut with this fresh sack of hydro, and this shit is creeper
Peep the street, bust again on Double Glock-glock with-ah-me rocks
Cops sweatin' me block
Copper better drop when the gunshot pop, blood, dumpin' the body and the bullshit stop
Whenever the trouble knocks with the po-po, niggas roll solo, split up, and swerve
Krayzie take caution, take all my llello and tossed it
See none when they roll to the curb

Gangstas on the sidelines
Throwing up nothing
But a peace sign

Brothers on the curb
With the herb
Levis, knee high

Crib to crib
Rolls up to kid's girls I dig
They all know me
So the ghetto stays cozy

Team to team
Sport a couple of trophys
One for the dope
And the other for the homie

The ghetto's a real
Fool place to be fucked up
Sundown to sunup

You ball and you gang bang
That's where the family hangs
So it ain't no thang

About a situation guys and girls know very well
Everything is fine and dandy and you love it
'Til dope make you treat another person like a puppet.

Now I talked to this girl for about two weeks
And I've been many places and seen many freaks
But this girl was just fly, her body good lookin
I was a fish just flappin' and she was like hookin

I got to know her by spending some time
She gave me things of hers for some things of mine
Everything was goin' good, couldn't nothing go better
Anything she wants to do, Hi-C would just let her

Wasn't like them other brothers trying to screw her up
I would take her to the mall, and straight cold do her up
Have a treat, and when she by my side
I want the girl to look good when she rollin' in my ride

But three weeks later I noticed a change
Somethin' wasn't right she was acting kinda strange
Took some money out my stash, and stuffed it in her purse
You think if things is gettin bad, man, it's gonna get worse

Well, looks like I got myself a few problems
But me, being Hi-C, you know I'm gonna solve 'em
She ran out the house, and drove down the street
Stopped to buy some crack from my homeboy Pete

I couldn't believe what I was told
He gave the freak double-up for a thick piece of gold
So I creeped up on on the girl, and said ""yeah, I caught ya""
""And by the way, where's the link I bought ya?""

Now this girl must've lost her mind
Scrapping up dough in some things of mine
I wanted to beat her. Better yet stomp her
Break out the 12-gauge and full of buckshot, pump her

But I said, nah forget it, I'm a chill
This girl need help, she's mentally I'll
She got to trip' and started spending my grip!
So I just had to rip the pipe out' her lips

She cried, ""Crawf, please gimme some money""
""I promise I'll stop, please, come on Crawf honey! ""
I felt sorry for the girl cause she's being misused
It was the crack and the devil, riding to abuse

This relationship just ain't gonna last
Girl, you gonna have to get rid of your past

If your mother says, don't chew it
Do you swallow it in spite?

Can you catch it on your tonsils?
Can you heave it left and right?

'Cause I'm like the Wizard, and you look lost like Dorothy

Words that split wigs hitting like some double Desert Eagles
Sporting caps pulled low, and baggy slacks
Subtracting all the rappers who lack over Premier's tracks

Severe facts have brought this rap game to near collapse
So as I have in the past, I whoop ass
Dropping lyrics that be hotter than sex and candlewax
And one-dimensional MC's can't handle that

While the world's revolving, on it's axis
I come with mad love and plus the illest warlike tactics

So many people searching for false bliss

For a Flying-type the win's easy
Good luck with Muk and its poison gas
Make one wrong move and it'll kick your grass

Hurting each other, me and you
Brought us much closer in the end

Kitty kat hittin' kid from the corner on a quest to rest in your nest
Straight from my shower to your sauna, yup!
Next crew, this ain't no Pepé Le Pew
This is what we do, ménage à trois we do
Too mean, too mad, too much to handle
Name is written like a mark and lit that kitten with a candle
And if ya go court on that have a rate court stuff
Come take a shortcut to Fort Nuts!
Many praise the way we play
Well, you know, what can I say?
Hit 'em low!

Oh, where's my kitty kat, where's my kitty cat at, strokin' me? (Hopin' she's open, G)
Oh, where's my kitty kat, where's my kitty cat at, strokin' me?

On and on, I coulda sworn I saw puddy cat
City titty cat, witty, pretty cat

Two priests came 'rounf
Our house tonight
One young, one old
To offer prayers for the dying to serve the final rite
One to learn, one to teach

Aa father's child was greater than gold but I guess not
You brought me into the world but you're not my dad
Mess around with those drugs makes my moms mad

So we left you with no remorsal pity, took the first bus
From York to Jersey City, women and child alone
Noww that's pressure, mom's got to go to work, drop me off
By Obesa momma, aunt DeDe, whoever aunt Falma, uncle Roy
We stuck together, a year went by and I could walk y'all

Moms got that good ol' job at city hall
She probably didn't trust men anymore
Until Philip Harrison walk though the door
Went out a few times but what about Shaquille
Mom's offered him a million dollar package deal
She said, ""You want me, you gotta take my son""

Or else it's like a hot dog but without the bun
Guess what he accepted, responsibility he never left it
He kept it, he kept it he took me from a boy to a man
So Phil is my father, 'cause my biological didn't bother

And there was so much left to dream
And so much time to make it real

But I can still recall the sting of all the tears when he was gone
They say he crashed and burned, I swear I'll never learn
Why any boy should die so young

We were racing; we were soldiers of fortune
We got in trouble but we sure got around
There are times I think I see him peeling out of the dark
I think he's right behind me now, and he's gaining ground

But it was long ago, and it was far away
Oh God, it seems so very far
And if life is just a highway, then the soul is just a car

Of the mighty Souls of Mischief crew
I'm chillin' with my man Phesto, my man A-Plus
And my man Op', you know he's dope (yo)
But right now, you know, we just maxin' in the studio
We hailin' from East Oakland, California
And, um, sometimes it gets a little hectic out there (haha, we just chillin')
But right now, yo, we gonna up you on how we just chill

Dial the seven digits, call up Bridgette
Her man's a midget; plus she got friends, yo, I can dig it
Here's a .40, swig it, you know it's frigid
I got 'em chillin' in the cooler, break out the ruler
Damn! That's the fattest stoge I ever seen
The weather's heat in Cali
Gettin' weeded makes it feel like Maui
Now we feel the good vibrations
So many females, so much inspiration

I get inspired by the blunts too (too)
I'll front you (you), if you hang with a bunk crew (chump)
I roam the strip for bones to pick
When I find one, I'm done
Take her home and quickly do this (yep)
I need not explain this (nah)
A-Plus is famous, so get the Anus

Hey, Miss! Who's there? I'm through there
No time to do hair, the flick's at eight, so get straight
You look great, let's grub now
A rubdown sounds flavor, later, there's the theatre
We in the cut, the cinema was mediocre
Take her to the crib so I can stroke her

Kids get broke for their skins when I'm in
Close range, I throws game at your dip
Like handball, 'cause the man's all that
All phat, I be the chill from '93 'til

Yeah, this is how we chill from '93 'til
This is how we chill from '93 'til

Now rock the crowd and get a pump-fist
Go Ice, everybody is sayin'
To the funky beat that's playing
If you wanna stop me you can't hang
Vanilla is in this with a shotgun bang
Extreme is where I'm taking it
One week MCs just keep on faking it
Smoooth, like strawberry ice cream
Flow with the beat real smooth and nicely
Ladies, I wanna rock with you
And later in the night, you know I'd like to persue
Something, real sexy and nice

Play that funky music Vanilla Ice!

Play that funky music riiight - Pump it up!

Grew up in Hell, now I dwell, in an Islamic Temple
I'm fighting a holy war in the mental

Dragging they asses on a by they temples

In single parenthood there I stood
By the time she was 21, had another one
This one's a girl, let's name her Pam
Same father as the first but you don't give a damn
Irresponsible, plain not thinking
Papa said chill but the brother keep winking
Still he won't down you or tear out your hide
On your side while the baby maker slide
But mama got wise to the game
The youngest of five kids, hon here it is
After 10 years without no spouse

Railroad Bill And The Kitten
Railroad Bill and the Kitten

SOURCE: Bob Pfeffer

SOURCE'S SOURCE: Andy Breckman

TEXT:

Railroad Bill was a hard livin' man
He used to take his women two at a time
Everyone agreed he was the baddest engineer
That'd ever driven down the Santa Fe line

His name was known from the folks back home
To the tippy-top of telegraph hill
And all the little boys, when they were sneakin' cigarettes
They used to dream about the Railroad Bill

[SPOKEN: Stay with me here
One day Bill was walkin' along
And he saw a kitten stuck in a tree
When he saw what was the matter he ran to get a ladder
To set that kitty-cat free

And Bill said, ""No, ain't gonna do it
Ain't gonna climb up no tree
This is a stupid, stupid song and no folksinger's
Gonna make a fool outa me.""

I said, one day Bill was walkin' along
And he saw a kitten stuck in a tree

I don't want nothing to do with you

I don't need your dirty love, I don't want you touching me

So take me down a lonesome road
Point me East and let me go
That suitcase weighs me down
With memories

I just wanna be the one you run to
I just wanna be the one you come to
I just wanna be there for someone
When the night comes

Let's put all the cares behind us
And go where they'll never find us
I just wanna be there beside you
When the night comes

Two spirits in the night
That can leave before the morning light
When there's nothing left to lose
And nothing left to fear

So meet me on the edge of town
Won't keep you waiting I'll be 'round
Then you and I
We'll just roll right out of here

A two bedroom house for his family of three
He's givin' his all, makin' ends meet
A secondhand car, a washing machine
They may not have much, but he gets what they need

Like going to the schoolyard for your late passes to class

Cutting in lunch lines leaving other students last
And strolling to the movies to see a rated R
When mom's dropped them off it's where E.T would be the star
Stealing was an issue that just could not be ignored
Taking tapes and 45s from the local record store
Being good kids to them was nothing but bologna

And leave a young mother to be a pappy

And since we all came from a woman
Got our name from a woman and our game from a woman
I wonder why we take from our women
Why we rape our women, do we hate our women?
I think it's time to kill for our women
Time to heal our women, be real to our women
And if we don't we'll have a race of babies
That will hate the ladies that make the babies

And since a man can't make one
He has no right to tell a woman when and where to create one
So will the real men get up?

Your cards were dealt when you drove through the night

Coming from my soul

Verse 1: (MACK DADDY and DADDY MACK)
Who gotcha open, scopin out the track
It's no other than the sounds of the Daddy Mack
Still slackin back-packin up my turf
Cause after me was a factor real worse at the worst
Stompin, jumpin wanna-be's
But ever however there's only one M A C (say what)
Me and Daddy for the big picture
Ways of gettin richer, mister quick to hit your sister
I'm ballin in the Green County on chrome
I slip brothers on the deck on my cellular phone
I'm just loungin, leather, sound all around
And a dip on the other end wanna put me down now
No hesitation I hops to it
See it ain't easy bein' a Mac but somebody gotta do it
True it's, usually not represented right

Can I sail through the changin' ocean tides?

Ask me now, I'm the artist but hardcore, my science for pain

Saw fiends shoot up and do lines of cocaine
Saw my close friends shot, flat line am I sane?
That depends, carry Mac-10's to practice my aim

On rooftops, tape CD covers to trees
Line the barrel up with your weak picture then squeeze
Street scriptures for lost souls in the crossroads
To the corner thugs hustlin' for cars that cost dough
To the big dogs livin' large, takin' it light
Pushin' big toys, gettin' nice, enjoyin' your life
Is what you make it, suicide, few try to take it
Belt tied around they neck in jail cells naked
Heaven and hell, rap legend, presence is felt
And of course N-A-S are the letters that spell Nas, Nas

After dreams of distant signs
You pour yourself, over me
Like the sun, through the blinds

You lift me up and get me out
Keep me walking,
But never shout
Hold the secret close I hear you say

You know the way It throws about
It takes you in and spits you out
It spits you out when you desire
To conquer it, to feel you're higher
To follow it you must be clean
With mistakes that you do mean
Move the heart, switch the pace
Look for what seems out of place

On and on it goes
Calling like a distant wind
Through the zero hour we'll walk
Cut the thick and break the thin

No sound to break, no moment clear

Excuse me Miss, but can I get your name
She said my name is Renee
I said I got a whole lot to say

So may I walk you to your subway
She said if you want
So yo, we started talking
I brought two franks and two drinks

And we began walking
I had to see where that head was at
Because the gear was mad phat
So we must chat about this and that

She told me what she was in school for
She wants to be a lawyer
In other words shorty studies law
I'm telling shorty I'm a writer

And as she's looking for the token
She drops a pack of the EZ-widers
Covers her mouth with her name ring
I said, yo don't sweat the technique shorty rocks

I do the same thing
But yet I use Philly Blunts
She said I never dealt with Philly Blunts
Because I heard that's for silly stunts
I said, nah they burn slower
Right now I really don't know ya
But maybe later on I can get to show ya

A ghetto love is the law that we live by
Day by day I wonder why my shorty had to die
I reminice over my ghetto princess everyday
Give it up for my shorty, shorty

A ghetto love is the law that we live by
Day by day I wonder why my shorty had to die
I reminice over my ghetto princess everyday
Give it up for my shorty, shorty

So now we sittin' on the train
Besides the fingernails
Now shorty got the hairdo of pain
Now I understand she got flava
A tough leather jacket, with some jeans and a chain that her moms gave her
Got off the train about six: thirtyfour

At the perfect matched heights

Like the boots with sand on my feet

Like a chandelier

Bit it's meant to be the poetry

I love you baby.
Sodapop.

You take the breath from me
Make my life heavenly
I can't believe the way the good Lord is blessin' me
One in a million, mother of my children
Me without you like car without engine
You listen to my dreams that I vision
Respect that I smoke Mary Jane, it's like my religion
The pigeons, sometimes make you worry
But I can see, you know my vision ain't blurry
The innocence, still strong like a feminist
I reminisce, on the first time we ever kissed
In the devilish world you my only angel
Cancel concerts to stay with you & watch cable
Kiss your navel, candlelights on the table
You never cared if I was financially stable
12 years, to me it feels like 12 minutes
My love for you, sees no limits.

Chorus:
Where would I be without you?
I know I wouldn't be rappin' into soundproof
I know I wouldn't be pushin' a Benz
I'd probably be gettin' transferred to different pens
Or chillin' with my dead friends
Or still at the weed house makin' 5's & 10's

On a hot summer night
He wrote, ""Billy Bob loves Charlene""
In letters three-foot high
And the whole town said that he should've used red

Raising sweet corn, kids, and tomatoes

Off to other cities and shit, no longer just an underground hit
Moving thangs, a local nigga made good
And made a name off of making tapes for niggaz in the hood
And now, let me tell a little story
About the places that I been to and the shit that I been through
Like fightin' and shootouts and bangin' and shit
All because a nigga made a hit, check it

Nineteen ninety one, it was double or nothin' that a nigga would hit
Then we broke out with the fonky shit
About bitches and niggaz and gettin' drunken off that bud
I was doing the shit they hadn't heard of
But foolish was I to think that it wasn't no other cities like this
And that they didn't like this
That Compton was the home of a foot in yo ass, where you got blast
And now that's just a thing of the past

Let me tell ya why firsthand, we did a show up in Oakland
And niggaz was kickin' up sand, to them bangin' ain't nothin' new
And slangin' ain't nothin' new
And for every nigga we done shot they done shot two
Straight through and on since the sixties before I was born
Families of young niggaz mourn
So I'm just letting you know
That if ya plan to take a trip to the bay keep your hand on the clip

Because Oakland
(It's jus lyke Compton)
Yeah, I'm telling y'all Oakland
(It's jus lyke Compton for y'all)

Moving on to St. Louis, where the country is fucked
With gold teeth ain't hey mouth, but they still know what's up
Where it's hot as a motherfucker, hot enough to make ya cuss
That's why I kept my ass on the bus
But later on, when it cooled off we came down
And met a couple of friends, who put us up on the St. Louis cap

Calls her sister up and cries, ""Get over here""

It won't do
It's like I'm

I cross my heart and hope to die
I'm only wishing you'd love me like that

Waiting, waiting, waiting
Waiting for you is
Is like blowing, blowing kisses

Old friend, here we are,
Lookin' back at all the years and tears that we've been through.
It feels so good to see you.
Lookin' back in time,
There's been other friends and other lovers,
But no other one like you.
All my life,
No one ever has known me better.

I must have traveled down a thousand roads.
Been so many places, seen so many faces,
Always on my way to somethin' new, oh.
But it doesn't matter 'cause no matter where I go,

Holding on is like the ways of the wind,
Holding on is like the ways of the wind

I wore a ring that was taken so hastily,
Thinking naively that it guaranteed my safety
I'm looking at eyes that have stumbled across a shooting star
Saying that's alright, I know the kind of man you are

Holding on is like the ways of the wind,
Holding on is like the ways of the wind

How many things I recall I can't take too far
She's good at collecting
And counting on the things you are
Forever racing the flames she loved to put me through
I was never a good seahorse
But I can practice rides on you
Another world, another space,
Another mind insists I'm crying
I once experienced time with you
Now a ll exists through rage and sighing
Simon says I love you

Insulate the bed
Shoot him up when he's dead.

He wants you to take his box kleenex and cut it with a knife
Use a stack of tissues for each hand
Killing germs could save his life
Climb into the cockpit
He drops his pants to grin
Just act like it's nothing
Just nod and smile at him.

To unite all peoples within our nation
To denounce the evils of truth and love
To extend our reach to the stars above

Let's get, let's get, let's get, let's get rocked

I'm your average, ordinary, everyday kid
Happy to do nothin', in fact that's what I did
I got a million ways to make my day, but daddy don't agree
'Cause when I try to get away, he says, he got plans for me

(Get your butt right out of bed) Stop buggin' me
(Get up and move your sleepy head) Don't shake my tree
He said, (""Mow the lawn"") Who me?
(Walk the dog) Not my style, man!
(Take out the trash) No way!
(Tidy your room) Come on, get real!
Sorry dad, gotta disappear
Let's get the rock outta here

Seven-day weekend, up all night
In at the deep end, hang on tight
It won't take a minute, it won't take long
So get on in it, come on, come on, come on

Let's get, let's get, let's get, let's get rocked
Let's get, let's get, let's get, let's get rocked
Let's go all the way, get it night'n'day

Get your tickets here, step right this way

Hello, you fool, I love you
C'mon join the joyride

I hit the road out of nowhere
I had to jump in my car
And be a rider in a love game
Following the stars
Don't need no book of wisdom
I get no money talk at all

She has a train goin' downtown
She's got a club on the moon
But she's tellin' all her secrets
In a wonderful balloon
She's the heart of the fun fair

What are your political views
Ooh, ooh
I really think that I could
Learn a lot from you

Although you do look nice

I really only want you

Do you plan a life of dreams

Being with you gets me that way
I watch the sunlight dance across your face
And I've never been this swept away

All my thoughts just seem to settle on the breeze
When I'm lying wrapped up in your arms
The whole world just fades away
The only thing I hear is the beating of your heart

'Cause I can feel you breathe
It's washing over me
And suddenly I'm melting into you
There's nothing left to prove
Baby, all we need is just to be
Caught up in the touch
Slow and steady rush

Where the white jasmine
Assembles at the rose,
On the river of flowers,
Laughing in the morning.
Come, let's descend together.

Gently, let's slip
Around its charming flood.
Let's follow the fleeing current
With one careless hand let's reach
For the bank,
Come, let's find the bank
Where the source sleeps.
And the birds, the birds sing.

Hail to the moon, just like Kunta Kinte
That means I'm gifted from the get-go
Mom's you never let go
Mad thanks for raising me right, bro'
You gave me confidence to stop the nonsense
Didn't live in Bel Air like the Fresh Prince
Times are hard, times are rough
Didn't have Toys R Us toys, but I had enough love
Plus the guidance from above
To go to the park, sweatin' push and shove
Maybe then for a dunk like you told me
Then there were a few times when Dad had to scold me
Prayed for my safety, I know how you was feeling
Didn't want me wheeling and get to drug-dealing
Remember when you asked me this one day
Who I wanna' be like, I said Dr. J
Then you said, ""Good, now you gotta' go
""Take the damn ball and slam it through the hole.""
Mom cracked a smile, Daddy gave a frown
I said to myself, ""I can't let them down.""
So make way, I'm coming in for a landing
And nothing's gonna' stop me, from being outstanding

And smoke a ticket at the same time
Drop a wicked bomb on my naughty nature

Bitch I'm not the woman to sleep but I'm lost (yo that's deep)
Cause I be on some ole' I'm tired of niggaz
Tryin to come up off bitches type thing (""What can I do?"")
And if I don't react the way he want he might swing
His little trick bitch ass in another direction
Then don't even use protection
I hate stupid shit assholes can avoid
Yo! And if worse came to worse I'll run a fraud on unemployed
Cause who the fuck cares that I got gray hairs and can't sleep
Know what I mean? (Yeah hell yeah, that's deep)

And when you push from behind I know I can
Cover a mountain with the palm of my hand
