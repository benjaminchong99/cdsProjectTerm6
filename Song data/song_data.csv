Intangible (aww dawg), bet you didn't think so I command you to
Panoramic view (you),
Look I'll make it all manageable
Pick and choose (hmph),
Sit and loose,
All you different crews.
Chicks and dudes,
So who you think is really kickin' tunes?
Picture you gettin down in tha picture tube,
Like you lit the fuse
You think it's fictional?
Mystical? maybe
Spiritual?
Hero who appears in you ta clear your view (yeah) but your too crazy

Done pleading ignorance
That whole defense

Spinning infinity, boy
The wheel is spinning me

Same old story

What if I say I'm not just another one of your plays?

Where you talk in Russian and Greek

They hang on every word you speak, yes they do.

Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night

Without granting innocence

He passed on, worried and warning
Carried away by a moonlight shadow

Lost in a riddle that Saturday night
Far away on the other side
He was caught in the middle of a desperate fight
And she couldn't find how to push through

The trees that whisper in the evening
Carried away by a moonlight shadow
Sing a song of sorrow and grieving
Carried away by a moonlight shadow

All she saw was a silhouette of a gun
Far away on the other side
He was shot six times by a man on the run

When I'm all choked up and you're OK?
I'm falling to pieces, yeah
I'm falling to pieces

They say bad things happen for a reason
But no wise words gonna stop the bleeding
'Cause she's moved on while I'm still grieving

You pull me through, when I get stuck in other little distractions

Dancing like there's no-one there

And they'll meet one day, far away and say

A man should be faithful
And walk when not able
And fight 'til the end, but I'm only human

In the last years of the nineteenth century
That human affairs were being watched from the timeless worlds of space

No one could have dreamed that we were being scrutinized
As someone with a microscope studies creatures that swarm and multiply in a drop of water
Few men even considered the possibility of life on other planets
And yet, across the gulf of space
Minds immeasurably superior to ours
Regarded this Earth with envious eyes
And slowly and surely, they drew their plans against us

At midnight, on the 12th of August
A huge mass of luminous gas erupted from Mars and sped towards Earth
Across two hundred million miles of void
Invisibly hurtling towards us
Came the first of the missiles that were to bring so much calamity to Earth

As I watched, there was another jet of gas
It was another missile, starting on its way

You escaped what I escaped
You'd be in Paris getting fucked up too

Lola Montez, so beautiful
Shady and a tempered dame
Blinding your eyes with her spider dance

Her perfomance utterly
Erotic subversive to all ideas
And for public morality
And cool as she was, she didn't care
See the miner throw his gold
Lifting her skirt, howling loud like a wolf
Hell raising and full of sin
When Lola was dancing and showing her skin

Wherever she walks
She will be captivating all the men

Don't look in her eyes
You might fall and find the love of your life

Heavenly
But she'll catch you in her web

Are there some aces up your sleeve?

How many secrets can you keep?
'Cause there's this tune I found
That makes me think of you somehow
And I play it on repeat, until I fall asleep
Spilling drinks on my settee

If this feeling flows both ways?

That the nights were mainly made
For saying things that you can't say tomorrow day

Crawling back to you
Ever thought of calling when you've had a few?

But it's the only thing that I know
When it gets hurt, you know I can get hurt sometimes
It is the only thing that makes us feel alive
We keep this love in a photograph
We make these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Hearts are never broken
Times were ever frozen still
So if you keep me inside the pocket of your reap jeans
Holding me close till our eyes meet

As strawberry wine
You're as warm
As a glass of brandy
And honey, I stay stoned on your love

I've looked for love in all the same old places

Tripping in the world could be dangerous
Everybody circling is vulturous
Negative, nepotist

Everybody waiting for the fall of man
Everybody praying for the end of times
Everybody hoping they could be the one

Whip, whip
Run me like a racehorse
Hold me like a ripcord
Break me down and build me up
I wanna be the slip, slip
Word upon your lip, lip
Letter that you rip, rip
Break me down and build me up

'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do whatever it takes
'Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains

Travel through the night 'cause there is no fear
Alone but right behind, until I watched you disappear

Just moving through the dark

Poured the old ginger beer down the sink

Rapper's Delight,The Sugarhill Gang,east coast hip hop,2017,112,75,91,-10,4,83,234,7,25,48,"I said a hip, hop, a hippie to the hippie
To the hip hip hop, you don't stop
The rockin' to the bang bang boogie say up jumps the boogie
To the rhythm of the boogity beat

Now what you hear is not a test, I'm rappin' to the beat
And me, the groove, and my friends, are gonna try to move your feet
You see, I am Wonder Mike, and I'd like to say hello
To the black, to the white, the red, and the brown, the purple and yellow
But first, I gotta bang bang the boogie to the boogie
Say up jump the boogie to the bang bang boogie
Let's rock, you don't stop
Rock the rhythm that will make your body rock

Well, so far you've heard my voice, but I brought two friends along
And next on the mic is my man Hank
Come on, Hank, sing that song

Check it out, I'm the C-A-S-AN-the-O-V-A
And the rest is F-L-Y
You see I go by the code of the doctor of the mix
And these reasons I'll tell ya why
You see I'm six foot one and I'm tons of fun
And I dress to a 'T'
You see I got more clothes than Muhammad Ali
And I dress so viciously

I got bodyguards, I got two big cars
That definitely ain't the whack
I got a Lincoln Continental and a sunroof Cadillac
So after school, I take a dip in the pool, which really is on the wall
I got a color TV so I can see the Knicks play basketball
Hear me talkin' 'bout checkbooks, credit cards
More money than a sucker could ever spend
But I wouldn't give a sucker or a bum from the rucker
Not a dime 'til I made it again

Everybody go hotel, motel, whatcha gonna do today? (say what?)
Ya say I'm gonna get a fly girl gonna get some spankin'
Drive off in a def O.J.
Everybody go, hotel, motel, Holiday Inn
Say if your girl starts actin' up, then you take her friend
Master Gee, am I mellow?
It's on you, so what you gonna do?

Well it's on an' on an' on on an' on
The beat don't stop until the break of dawn
I said M-A-S, T-E-R, a G with a double E
I said I go by the unforgettable name of the man they call the Master Gee
Well, my name is known all over the world by all the foxy ladies and the pretty girls
I'm goin' down in history as the baddest rapper there ever could be

Now I'm feelin' the highs and you're feelin' the lows
The beat starts gettin' into your toes
Ya start poppin' ya fingers and stompin' your feet
And movin' your body while you're sittin' in your seat
And then damn, you start doin' the freak
I said damn, right outta your seat
Then ya throw your hands high in the air
Ya rockin' to the rhythm, shake your derriere
Ya rockin' to the beat without a care
With the sureshot MCs for the affair

Now, I'm not as tall as the rest of the gang
But I rap to the beat just the same
I got a little face and a pair of brown eyes
All I'm here to do ladies is hypnotize
Singin' on an' an' on an' on an' on
The beat don't stop until the break of dawn
Singin' on n n on n on on n on
Like a hot buttered a pop da pop da pop dibbie dibbie
Pop da pop pop ya don't dare stop
Come alive y'all, gimme what ya got

I guess by now you can take a hunch
And find that I am the baby of the bunch
But that's okay, I still keep in stride
'Cause all I'm here to do is just wiggle your behind
Singin' on an' an' on an' on an' on
The beat don't stop until the break of dawn
Singin' on an' an' on an' on on an' on
Rock, rock y'all, throw it on the floor

I'm gonna freak ya here, I'm gonna freak ya there
I'm gonna move you outta this atmosphere
'Cause I'm one of a kind and I'll shock your mind
I'll put t-t-tickets in your behind
I said 1-2-3-4, come on girls, get on the floor
A-come alive y'all, a-gimme what ya got
'Cause I'm guaranteed to make you rock
I said 1-2-3-4, tell me Wonder Mike what are you waitin' for?

I said a hip hop the hippie to the hippie
The hip hip hop, a you don't stop
The rockin' to the bang bang boogie say up jumped the boogie
To the rhythm of the boogity beat
Skiddlee beebop we rock a Scoobie-Doo
And guess what America we love you
Cause ya rock and ya roll with so much soul
You could rock till you're a hundred and one years old
I don't mean to brag i don't mean to boast
But we like hot butter on our breakfast toast
Rock it up baby bubba
Baby bubba to the boogie da bang bang da boogie
To the beat beat, its so unique
Come on everybody and dance to the beat

I said a hip hop the hippie the hippie
To the hip hip hop, a-you don't stop
Rock it out, pretty bubba to the boogity bang, bang,
The boogie to the boogity beat

I said I cant wait 'til the end of the week
When I'm rappin' to the rhythm of a groovy beat
And attempt to raise your body heat
Just blow your mind so that you can't speak
And do a thing but a-rock and shuffle your feet
And let it change up to a dance called the freak
And when you finally do come in to your rhythmic beat
Rest a little while so ya don't get weak
I know a man named Hank

Didn't know how, but I always had a feeling
I was gonna be that one in a million
Always had high, high hopes

Be something greater, go make a legacy""
Manifest destiny back in the days

Rewrite your history, light up your wildest dreams""

But if you give me just one night
You're gonna see me in a new light

Do we stand a chance to rise above it all

Lay your weapons down
And I'll take my armor off

And love before it's lost

And real can hurt sometimes

You're still young, that's your fault
There's so much you have to know

Find a girl, settle down
If you want you can marry
Look at me, I am old
But I'm happy

I was once like you are now
And I know that it's not easy
To be calm when you've found
Something going on

But take your time, think a lot

With a thousand million questions about hate and death and war?
'Cause when we stop and look around us, there is nothing that we need
In a world of persecution that is burning in its greed

Why do we never get an answer when we're knocking at the door?
Because the truth, it's hard to swallow, that's what the war of love is for

It's not the way that you say it
When you do those things to me
It's more the way that you mean it
When you tell me what will be

And when you stop and think about it
You won't believe it's true
That all the love you've been giving
Has all been meant for you

I was playing soft while Bobby sang the blues.
Windshield wipers slapping time, I was holding Bobby's hand in mine,
We sang every song that driver knew.

Freedom is just another word for nothing left to lose,
Nothing don't mean nothing honey if it ain't free, now now.
And feeling good was easy, Lord, when he sang the blues,
You know feeling good was good enough for me,
Good enough for me and my Bobby McGee.

Oh, mirror in the sky
What is love?
Can the child within my heart rise above?
Can I sail through the changin' ocean tides?
Can I handle the seasons of my life?

She rules her life like a fine skylark
And when the sky is starless
All your life you've never seen

How to open doors with just a smile
A rich old man, and she won't have to worry
She'll dress up all in lace go in style

Late at night a big old house gets lonely
I guess every form of refuge has its price
And it breaks her heart to think her love is only
Given to a man with hands as cold as ice

So she tells him she must go out for the evening
To comfort an old friend who's feelin' down
But he knows where she's goin' as she's leavin'
She is headed for the cheatin' side of town

You can't hide your lyin' eyes
And your smile is a thin disguise
I thought by now you'd realize
There ain't no way to hide your lyin' eyes

And high school girls with clear skinned smiles
Who married young and then retired

The valentines I never knew
The friday night charades of youth
Were spent on one more beautiful
At seventeen I learned the truth

And those of us with ravaged faces
Lacking in the social graces
Desperately remained at home
Inventing lovers on the phone

Who called to say come dance with me
And murmured vague obscenities
It isn't all it seems

Spent my life running 'round

Keep on turning out and burning out

So put me on a highway
And show me a sign

You can spend all your love making time

Would you still be mine?

And how they loved the land
And they came from everywhere
To the Great Divide
Seeking a place to stand
Or a place to hide

Out for a good time

Enter Patty Valentine from the upper hall
She sees the bartender in a pool of blood
Cries out, ""My God, they've killed them all!""

Here comes the story of the Hurricane
The man the authorities came to blame
For somethin' that he never done
Put in a prison cell, but one time he could-a been
The champion of the world

Three bodies lyin' there does Patty see
And another man named Bello, movin' around mysteriously
""I didn't do it,"" he says, and he throws up his hands
""I was only robbin' the register, I hope you understand""

""I saw them leavin',"" he says, and he stops
""One of us had better call up the cops""
And so Patty calls the cops
And they arrive on the scene
With their red lights flashin' in the hot New Jersey night

Meanwhile, far away in another part of town
Rubin Carter and a couple of friends are drivin' around
Number one contender for the middleweight crown
Had no idea what kinda shit was about to go down

When a cop pulled him over to the side of the road
Just like the time before and the time before that
In Paterson that's just the way things go
If you're black you might as well not show up on the street
'Less you wanna draw the heat

Alfred Bello had a partner and he had a rap for the cops
Him and Arthur Dexter Bradley were just out prowlin' around
He said, ""I saw two men runnin' out, they looked like middleweights
They jumped into a white car with out-of-state plates""

And Miss Patty Valentine just nodded her head
Cop said, ""Wait a minute, boys, this one's not dead""

We can beat them, just for one day
We can be Heroes, just for one day

And you, you can be mean
And I, I'll drink all the time
'Cause we're lovers, and that is a fact
Yes, we're lovers, and that is that

Though nothing, will keep us together
We could steal time, just for one day
We can be Heroes, for ever and ever

Paradise By the Dashboard Light,Meat Loaf,album rock,1977,173,87,33,-8,46,49,508,21,12,67,"Well I remember every little thing
As if it happened only yesterday
Parking by the lake
And there was not another car in sight
And I never had a girl
Looking any better than you did
And all the kids at school
They were wishing they were me that night

And now our bodies are oh so close and tight
It never felt so good, it never felt so right
And we're glowing like the metal on the edge of a knife
Glowing like the metal on the edge of a knife
C'mon! Hold on tight!
C'mon! Hold on tight!

Though it's cold and lonely in the deep dark night
I can see paradise by the dashboard light

Ain't no doubt about it
We were doubly blessed
'Cause we were barely seventeen
And we were barely dressed
Ain't no doubt about it
Baby got to go and shout it
Ain't no doubt about it
We were doubly blessed
'Cause we were barely seventeen
And we were barely dressed

Baby don't you hear my heart
You got it drowning out the radio
I've been waiting so long
For you to come along and have some fun
Well I gotta let you know
No, you're never gonna regret it
So open up your eyes I got a big surprise
It'll feel all right
Well I wanna make your motor run

And now our bodies are oh so close and tight
It never felt so good, it never felt so right
And we're glowing like the metal on the edge of a knife
Glowing like the metal on the edge of a knife
C'mon! Hold on tight!
Well c'mon! Hold on tight!

Though it's cold and lonely in the deep dark night
I can see paradise by the dashboard light
Though it's cold and lonely in the deep dark night
(Lonely in the deep dark night)
Paradise by the dashboard light

You got to do what you can
And let Mother Nature do the rest
Ain't no doubt about it
We were doubly blessed
'Cause we were barely seventeen
And we were barely-

We're gonna go all the way tonight, we're gonna go all the way and tonight's the night
We're gonna go all the way tonight we're gonna go all the way and tonight's the night

Everyone turned to the rear of the room
To that worn down piano, a bit out of tune

But the crowds have all gone and the symphony's through

Got a new wife, got a new life

At the village green
Engineer boots, leather jackets
And tight blue jeans

Cold beer, hot lights

And the king and the queen

Listening to a man I've never known before
Telling me about the sea
All his love is 'til eternity

We Belong to the Night,Ellen Foley,pop,1979,101,75,36,-9,23,42,321,0,4,40,"The burning sun hangs over the city
You and me baby, we don't feel nothing at all
From nine to five we're lost
This life ain't so pretty
But when the sun goes down
We know that we can stay and talk

I just can't wait
For the night to come
Cause when the shadows cover the light
We're the only ones
Cause baby, we
We belong to the night
Yes, baby, we
We belong to the night
By day we just survive
But after dark, we come alive
Cause baby, we
We belong to the night

Hot summer night in Sausalito
Can't stand the heat another mile
Let's drop a quarter in the meter
And hit the sidewalk for a while

There was something going on

You do something to me that I can't explain
Hold me closer and I feel no pain
Every beat of my heart
We got something going on

Tender love is blind
It requires a dedication
All this love we feel
Needs no conversation
We ride it together, uh huh
Makin' love with each other, uh huh

Islands in the stream
That is what we are
No one in between
How can we be wrong?
Sail away with me
To another world
And we rely on each other, uh huh
From one lover to another, uh huh

I can't live without you

Sometime when it always seemed to be just us and them
Girls that wore pink and boys that wore blue
Boys that always grew up better men than me and you

What's a man now?
What's a man mean?
Is he rough or is he rugged?
Is he cultural and clean?
Now it's all change, it's got to change more
'Cause we think it's getting better
But nobody's really sure

And so it goes, go round again
But now and then we wonder who the real men are

And we can sing just like our fathers

Come on Eileen, oh I swear what he means
At this moment, you mean everything
With you in that dress my thoughts I confess
Verge on dirty, ah come on Eileen

Wear beaten down eyes sunk in smoke dried faces
So resigned to what their fate is
But not us, no never, no not us, no never

I wanna live out by the sea
Have a husband and some children

And the men are all the same
You don't look at their faces
And you don't ask their names

I'm your private dancer
A dancer for money

She will play around and leave you
Leave you and deceive you
Better forget it

Since when were you so generous and inarticulate
I want you
Its the stupid details that my heart is breaking for
Its the way your shoulders shake and what theyre shaking for
Its knowing that he knows you now after only guessing

I live on the second floor
I live upstairs from you
Yes I think you've seen me before

If you hear something late at night
Some kind of trouble, some kind of fight
Just don't ask me what it was
Just don't ask me what it was
Just don't ask me what it was

I think it's because I'm clumsy
I try not to talk too loud
Maybe it's because I'm crazy
I try not to act too proud

Feed it off an aux, speak, grunt, no, strength
The ladder starts to clatter with fear fight, down, height
Wire in a fire, representing seven games
And a government for hire and a combat site

Left of west and coming in a hurry with the Furies
Breathing down your neck
Team by team, reporters baffled, trumped, tethered, cropped
Look at that low playing, fine, then
Uh-oh, overflow, population, common food
But it'll do, save yourself, serve yourself
World serves its own needs, listen to your heart bleed
Dummy with the rapture and the revered in the right, right
You vitriolic, patriotic, slam fight, bright light
Feeling pretty psyched

There's a tree where the doves go to die
There's a piece that was torn from the morning
And it hangs in theGallery of Frost

Take this waltz, take this waltz
Take this waltz with the clamp on its jaws

Oh I want you, I want you, I want you
On a chair with a dead magazine
In the cave at the tip of the lily
In some hallway where love's never been
On a bed where the moon has been sweating
In a cry filled with footsteps and sand

Followed him up to the gates of Graceland

Of what might happen that night
I couldn't stand to hear the crying
Of my mother, and I remember when
I swore that that would be the last they'd see of me
And I never went home again

They say that time is a healer
And now my wounds are not the same

I am laying down my guns
I am broken like an arrow
Forgive me, forgive your wayward son

(Everybody needs somebody to love) mother, mother
(Everybody needs somebody to hate) please believe me
(Everybody's bitching 'cause they don't get enough)
And it's hard to hold on when there's no one to lean on

(Faith!) You know you're gonna live through the rain
Lord, we've gotta keep the faith
(Faith!) Don't you let your love turn to hate
Now we've gotta keep the faith

Keep the faith, keep the faith
Lord, we've gotta keep the faith

Tell me, baby, when I hurt you

I think you might like to hear something from us
Nice and easy but there's just one thing
You see, we never ever do nothing nice and easy
We always do it nice and rough

So we're gonna take the beginning of this song and do it easy
Then we're gonna do the finish rough
This is the way we do 'Proud Mary'
And we're rolling, rolling, rolling on the river
Listen to the story

Left a good job in the city
Working for the man every night and day
And I never lost one minute of sleeping
Worrying 'bout the way that things might have been

Big wheel keep on turning
Proud Mary keep on burning
And we're rolling, rolling
Rolling on the river

Cleaned a lot of plates in Memphis
I pumped a lot of tane down in New Orleans
But I never saw the good side of the city

Some days it dont come hard
Some days it dont come at all,
And these are the days that never end.

Some nights you breath fire,
Some nights your carved in ice,
Some nights your like nothing I've ever seen before, Or will again.

Maybe Im crazy, But it's crazy and it's true,
I know you can save me, No one else can save me now but you.

As long as the planets are turning,
As long as the stars are burning,
As long as your dreams are coming true - You better believe it! -

That I would do anything for love,
And I'll be there until the final act -
I would do anything for love!
And I'll take a Vow and Seal a pact -

But I'll never forgive myself if we dont go all the way - Tonight -
I would do anything for love!
I would do anything for love,
I would do anything for love,
But I wont do that, I wont do that...

I would do anything for love,

And so you're back, from outer space
I just walked in to find you here with that sad look upon your face
I should have changed that stupid lock
I should have made you leave your key
If I'd known for just one second, you'd be back to bother me

Go on now, go, walk out the door
Just turn around now 'cause you're not welcome anymore
Weren't you the one who tried to hurt me with ""goodbye""?

You think I'd lay down and die?

Running before times took our dreams away

Too many bitter tears are raining down on me
I'm far away from home
And I've been facing this alone for much too long, oh

I feel like no one ever told the truth to me
About growing up and what a struggle it would be
In my tangled state of mind
I've been looking back to find
Where I went wrong

Too much love will kill you
If you can't make up your mind
Torn between the lover and the love you leave behind
You're headed for disaster 'cause you never read the signs

On a live wire right up off the street

June bug skipping like a stone
With the headlights pointed at the dawn

To shake these zipper blues
And we don't know
Just where our bones will rest
To dust I guess
Forgotten and absorbed
Into the earth below

When I was young, me and my mama had beef
17 years old, kicked out on the streets
Though back at the time I never thought I'd see her face
Ain't a woman alive that could take my mama's place
Suspended from school, and scared to go home, I was a fool
With the big boys breakin' all the rules

I shed tears with my baby sister, over the years
We was poorer than the other little kids
And even though we had different daddies, the same drama
When things went wrong we'd blame Mama
I reminisce on the stress I caused, it was hell
Huggin' on my mama from a jail cell

And who'd think in elementary, hey
I'd see the penitentiary one day?
And runnin' from the police, that's right
Mama catch me, put a whoopin' to my backside
And even as a crack fiend, Mama
You always was a black queen, Mama
I finally understand
For a woman it ain't easy tryin' to raise a man

You always was committed
A poor single mother on welfare, tell me how you did it
There's no way I can pay you back
But the plan is to show you that I understand
You are appreciated

Upon my tongue
I teased at life as if it were
A foolish game
The way the evening breeze
May tease a candle flame

The thousand dreams I've dreamed
The splendid things I planned
I always built alas
On weak and shifting sand
I lived by night and shunned
The naked light of day
And only now I see
How the years ran away

Yesterday, when I was young
So many drinking songs
Were waiting to be sung

You were the grace that placed itself
Where lives were torn apart
You called out to our country
And you whispered to those in pain
Now you belong to heaven
And the stars spell out your name

And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never fading with the sunset
When the rain set in
And your footsteps will always fall here
Along England's greenest hills
Your candle's burned out long before
Your legend ever will

Loveliness we've lost

Then I see the look in your eyes

It ran one step ahead
As we followed in the dance

In love's hot, fevered iron

Someone left the cake out in the rain

'Cause it took so long to bake it
And I'll never have that recipe again, oh no

I recall the yellow cotton dress
Foaming like a wave
On the ground around your knees

Only time will bring peace to meand
