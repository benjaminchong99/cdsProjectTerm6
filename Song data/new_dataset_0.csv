Waiting up, couldn't sleep without you
Thinking of all the times we shared

I remember when my heart broke
I remember when I gave up loving you
My heart couldn't take no more of you
I was sad and lonely

I remember when I walked out
I remember when I screamed I hated you
But somehow deep inside, still loving you
Sad and lonely

I gave him a gentle shake
When he opened up his eyes
I said, ""Old man are you ok?""

He said, ""I just climbed out of a cottonwood tree
I was runin' from some honey bees
Drip dryin' in the summer breeze
After jumpin' into Calico creek
I was walkin' down an old dirt road
Past a field of hay that had just been mowed
Man, I wish you'd just left me alone

Bad boy to the bone
He'd say, ""Can't trust that other feller""
He'd judge 'em by the tone of their skin

He was raised to think like his Dad
Narrow mind, full of hate
On the road to nowhere fast
Till the Grace of God got in the way

Then he saw the light and hit his knees
And cried and said a prayer
Rose up a brand new man
Left the old one right there

Here's to the strong
Thanks to the brave
Don't give up hope
Some people change

Got on my knees and asked my Lord
To keep me clear from the devil cause my girl

Yeah, now everything is so cool
Yeah

But give me them back shots, I want them back shots
I said shawty let me play up in that matchbox
And she's on fire, yeahh
Sh-shawty let a nigga rub his stick against her matchbox
And she's on fire
She's steaming, she's screaming
She-she's creaming
She's fiending, I redeem it
I get between it, like I mean it

Now hit me

Ran her for years, 'til the transom got rotten
A piece of my childhood, will never be forgoten

A '75 Johnson with electric choke
A young boy two hands on the wheel
I can't replace the way it made me feel

And I would make it whine
He'd say, You can't beat the way an old wood boat rides

But six feet down in potter's earth is where you'll really dwell

Your brain begins to ooze with the secrets of the dead
As your casket closes
The darkness of the tomb, an eternity of dread

As your casket's covered feel the cruel hand of time
Ectoplasmic tendrils, enveloping in slime

Sculpting death in madness obsessed.

A timeless torture foretold in a sky of black

In the time before the light
In flames of Death's eternal reign
We ride towards the fight
When the darkness has fallen down
And the times are tough, alright
The sound of evil laughter falls
Around the world tonight

Fighting hard, fighting on for the steel
Through the wastelands evermore
The scattered souls will feel the hell
Bodies wasted on the shores
On the blackest plains in hell's domain
We watch them as we go
In fire and pain, and once again
We know

So now we fly ever free
We're free before the thunderstorm
On towards the wilderness our quest carries on
Far beyond the sundown
Far beyond the moonlight

He said, ""I'm heading back from business in New York and Rome""
Tell me son, where do you call home?

I said I'm from the front pew of a wooden white church
A court house clock that still don't work
Where a man's word means everything

Where moms and dads were high school flames
Gave their children grandmothers' maiden name

In the dark, can you tell me what it means?

I lay my head on my pillow
Staring out the window
Wish on a star for a sign
Is the reason why

You're always on my mind
When you come around, I get shy
When I see you, when I see you
Never know when you might walk by
So I gotta be right on time

All lined in rows when you open up the wardrobe doors

We live to it, look at what we did to it
Or what it did to us this is not just music
It's not kid music, these are grown men
On the microphone who like to condone their own sin
For us it's holy ground, Hip-hop is holy now
Long as I got the microphone I'm a hold it down
But when I pass the mic back it's back to you know what
But we don't recommend you listen I mean you know us

Your evening will be nice
And you can go and send me on my way

The moment you embark
There is that joke you're bound to hear
""A lawyer is a shark""
Ignore that, it's simplistic and it's dumb
Only some of you will turn out sharks, just some
The rest are chum

Our topic is
Blood in the water
Kids, it's time you faced
Law school is a waste
Oh yes, unless you acquire a taste for
Blood in the water
Dark and red and raw
You're nothing until the thrill of the kill
Becomes your only law

Mr. Schultz
Hypothetical question
Would you be willing to defend
The following banker accused of fraud?

A kind old grandma took her savings and she sent it
Off to your client, all she saved since she was born
Well he promised to invest it, but he spent it
On prostitutes and heroin and porn

No, I would not want to take that case!
Wrong! This one is a win unless you're lazy
Grandma's broke, she'll have some hack from legal aid
Put her on the stand and call her old and crazy
Your guy goes free and he can get you high and laid

Look for the blood in the water
Read your Thomas Hobbs
Only spineless snobs
Will quarrel with the morally dubious jobs
Yes, blood in the water
Your scruples are a flaw

No naked beauty nor a warm smile.
But the Power to leave stars and worlds

One's hanging on my shirttail
Another's locked up in her room
And I'm yelling up the stairs
Stop worrying about your hair

Then they're fighting in the backseat
And I'm playing referee
Now someone's gotta go
The moment that we leave
And everybody's late
I swear that I can't wait
Till they grow up

Then they do
And that's how it is
It's just quiet in the morning
Can't believe how much you miss
All they do
And all they did

And boy I know I feel the same my temperature's through the roof

If it's a camera up in here
Then it's gonna leave with me when I do, I do
If it's a camera up in here
Then I best not catch this flick on YouTube, YouTube
'Cause if you run your mouth and brag about this secret rendezvous
I will hunt you down
'Cause they be all up in my business like a Wendy interview
But this is private, between you and I

Touch my body, put me on the floor
Wrestle me around, play with me some more
Touch my body, throw me on the bed
I just wanna make you feel like you never did

Touch my body, let me wrap my thighs
All around your waist, just a little taste

Stay up all night with the stars
Confess all the faith that I had in you (I had in you)

Too late, I'm sure and lonely
Another night, another dream wasted on you
Just be here now against me
You know the words
So sing along for me, baby

For heaven's sake I know you're sorry
But you won't stop crying
This anniversary may never be the same
Inside I hope you know I'm dying
With my heart beside me
In shattered pieces that may never be replaced
And if I died right now you'd never be the same

I thought with a month of apart
Together would find us an opening
And moonlight would provide the spark

If this is Tuesday night I'm bowling
If you've got somethin' to sell
You're wastin' your time, I'm not buyin'
If it's anybody else, wait for the tone
You know what to do
And P.S. if this is Austin, I still love you

That anywhere else you could possibly go
After New York would be, a pleasure cruise

Now you're talking
Well, I'm thwarted by a metaphysic puzzle
And I'm sick of grading papers that are low
I'm shouting in my sleep, I need a muzzle

I gotta let my spirit be free to
Admit that I'm wrong and then change my mind
Sorry but I have to move on and leave you behind

I can't waste time so give it a moment, I realize nothing's broken
No need to worry about everything I've done
Live every second like it was my last one
Don't look back, got a new direction

You're still a part of everything I do
You're on my heart just like a tattoo

Could it be the little wrinkle over your nose

And sex you all over the place, yeah

Every time you scream at me
I wanna kiss you

Bring along a sip to make it all so sexual

With the whole city fast asleep, out cold
True words seem to rise to the lips, take hold
Of a poet in me, most powerfully
I feel free when the world doesn't owe it to me
It's so hard to find a gig that lives up to the billing
Trying to find a reason to work, god willing
I admit, my thinking is wishful
Like a star upon a child gazing up to the ceiling
How far do we have to stretch the truth
To fit the lifestyles borrowed and overdue
We can take it all back to the register
And start all over from the canister
Let's break it all down into pieces of bright
Moments that pass by like a meteorite

You prepared rocking a skirt
And your heels so tall
And we ain't with none of that tricking but our bills so tall
I've been peeping you for a while and you're throwing it back
If you looking for you a balla we got dough in the back
Look your color camello brown
And your skin so smooth
I'm having fantasies about what you and me can do
And you an undercover freak
You probably thinking the same
I'm seeing light up on your face because you peeping my chain
And I ain't tryna put you out there as if you a freak
So don't even take it that way just say you did it for me
And yeah you probably roll with me 'cause it's money in my pockets
So before then I gotta see you pop lock and drop it

How many bags you packed, just to take him back
Tell me that how many either ors
But no more if you let me inside of your inside your world
There'll be one less lonely girl

Saw so many pretty faces before I saw you, you
Now all I see is you
I'm coming for you
(I'm coming for you)

Don't need these other pretty faces like I need you
And when you're mine in the world
There's gonna be one less lonely girl

I'm coming for you, one less lonely girl

I'm coming for you, one less lonely girl

I got this chick from Cali, profilin', she's whilin'
She's gangsta, she knows that she's got it like that
We was driving on Crenshaw and cruisin for food when
She pulled up beside me sat off in a 'Lac
And I said ""Damn girl you acting like you don't know never seen me before
Episode of Cribs on MTV, video what you think TS stand for?""
She said ""Terrific Sex"", yeah that's who and the diamonds is no facade
Used to be a broke nigga from the BX
Now I'm rich got the world screamin Terror Squad
Think about it now, everywhere we go
Every other city we tour, they never say no
Seems like every other night I got a different chick beggin me...

She wanna take me home and lay me up inside her home
She wanna turn me on, breakfast in the mornin'
She said ""Daddy let me take ya home
Papi let me take ya home""
And I said ""Mami you can take me home

Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore,
While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,
As of someone gently rapping, tapping at my chamber door.
""'Tis some visitor,"" I muttered, ""tapping at my chamber door-
Only this, and nothing more.""

Ah, distinctly I remember it was in a bleak December,
And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.
Eagerly I wished the morrow;- vainly I had sought to borrow
From my books surcease of sorrow- sorrow for the lost Lenore-
For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore-
Nameless here for evermore.

And the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain
Thrilled me- filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;
Presently to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating,
""'Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door-
Some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door;-
Merely this, and nothing more.""

Out into the darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,
Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before;
But the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token,
And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, ""Lenore!""
This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, ""Lenore!""-
Merely this, and nothing more.

Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,
Soon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before.

Your best friend, your baby, your man or your lady
Put your hand way up high
We won't never say bye (no, no, no)
Mamas, daddies, sisters, brothers, friends and cousins
This is for my people who lost their grandmothers
Lift your head to the sky
'Cause we won't never say bye

As a child, there were the times
I didn't get it, but you kept me alive
I didn't know why you didn't show up sometimes on Sunday mornings
And I missed you, but I'm glad we talked through
All them grown folk things' separation brings
You never let me know it, you never let it show because you loved me and obviously
There's so much more left to say if you were with me today, face to face

I never knew I could hurt like this
And everyday life goes on, I wish I could talk to you for a while
Miss you, but I try not to cry
As time goes by
And it's true that you've reached the better place
Still, I'd give the world to see your face
And be right here next to you
But it's like you've gone too soon and the hardest thing to do is say bye

Sway of your hips round rings true

Changed my life so it seems
A fall breeze blows outside
I don't break stride
Thoughts are warm
And they go deep inside of you

And I never felt alone
Alright
Oh oh

Suddenly I'm lost on my street, on my block

Can't you see, I'm losing my mind this time?
This time I think it's for real, I can see
All the tree tops turning red
The beggars near bodegas grin at me

Well, I know that it gets so hard sometimes

Other bands play - Manowar kill

We got the biggest amps, man, they blast
The true metal people wanna rock, not pose
Wearin' jeans and leather

I know it's hard to feel

With these lights off as these wheels

Keep rolling on and on (and on and on and on)
Slow things down or speed them up
Not enough or way too much (and on and on and on)
How are you when I'm gone?

And I can't make it on my own
(And I can't make it on my own)
Because my heart is in Ohio

So cut my wrists and black my eyes
(So cut my wrists and black my eyes)
So I can fall asleep tonight or die
Because you kill me

You know you do, you kill me well
You like it too and I can tell
You'll never stop until
My final breath is gone

Spare me just three last words

So before we get into the things that we shouldn't do
I'm a need your undivided attention
Cause it's fantasies and reality
Baby which one are we living in, oh

When it hurts, will we still be
The same two lovers
All over each other
When it hurts, will we still see
What we got together
Promise that we'll never
Never ever be
Temporary (Not another)
Ordinary
We should change people's definition of love
So forget what you heard
The only way that this will work
Is if you love me when it hurts

Can you love when it hurts

I don't wanna blend in
With every other relationship that be falling in and out girl (Not us)

My father took me into the city

Would you be the savior of the broken,
The beaten and the damned?""
He said ""Will you defeat them,
Your demons, and all the non-believers,
The plans that they have made?""
""Because one day I'll leave you,
A phantom to lead you in the summer,
To join The Black Parade.""

And other times I feel like I should go.
And through it all, the rise and fall, the bodies in the streets.
And when you're gone we want you all to know.

We'll carry on,
We'll carry on
And though you're dead and gone believe me

I only keep myself this sick in the head
'Cause I know how the words get you

We're the new face of failure
Prettier and younger but not any better off
Bulletproof loneliness at best, at best

Me and you, setting in a honeymoon
If I woke up next to you, if I woke up next to you
Me and you, setting in a honeymoon
If I woke up next to you, if I woke up next to you

Collect the bad habits that you couldn't bear to keep

In front of me stands the glorious grand city
A feeling that I can breathe, and be free

Silver-plated streets that glimmer and shine
Statues, monuments and fountains filled with wine
And trees nearly touching the sky

Stuck up their nose

So picture perfect at 13, an ebony queen

Nobody knew about her secret, so it took a while
I could see a tear fall slow down her black cheek
Sheddin' quiet tears in the back seat
So, when she asked me, ""What would you do if it was you?""

Couldn't answer such a horrible pain to live through
I tried to trade places in the tragedy
I couldn't picture three crazed niggas grabbin' me
For just a moment I was trapped in the pain
Lord, come and take me
Four niggas violated, they chased and they raped me
Even though it wasn't me, I could feel the grief
Thinkin' with your brains blown, that would make the pain go
No, you got to find a way to survive
'Cause they win when your soul dies

I got the cush, Kettle One, waiting for your engine
Your Grand Prix attention, it's gonna be a party

Don't forget to make a U-turn
I see you left your blinker on
I got it rolled and ready here to burn
Meet me back at home, a-oh, a-oh

Drive back baby to me, fast in your car

I am Rosemary's granddaughter
The spitting image of my father
And when the day is done
My momma's still my biggest fan
Sometimes I'm clueless and I'm clumsy
But I've got friends that love me
And they know just where I stand
It's all a part of me
And that's who I am

So when I make a big mistake
When I fall flat on my face
I know I'll be alright

She put on dark glasses and long sleeved blouses

""No Sir,"" ""Yes, Ma'am,"" ""By God,"" ""Be darned,""
""Hell yeah, I'm American.""
In all the years he walked this earth,
I swear all he did was work.
He said: ""The devil dreams on an idle horse,

Once I'm in the zone ain't no stoppin' me
'Coz you can jumpa baby humma girls be jockin' me
Them Miller boyz wear No Limit gear from head to feet

It's like that whodi, why won't you be my baby

When it walked out your front door
Where you fell down to your knees
And can't forget the kind of suitcase
That was packed out on the sidewalk
While you cried there beggin' please

You can lie and tell yourself
You're over it and someone else will take love's place
And this is for the best
You can lie in that bed
In a stranger's arms reachin' for comfort
Close your eyes and still get no rest

Cause love remembers
The smell of a summer day
Lying in a hammock over fresh cut grass
And the promise of forever
Yeah love remembers

Can you feel it slip away when it's all on you? Hey, hey

Time, time, 18 and life in Chino
Freud, Freud, all along it's true
Well, you'll see there comes a day catches up to you, yeah

Knock down the walls (it's alive in you)
Knock down the place (you're alone, it's true)
Knock down the world (it's alive in you)
You gotta keep your head up through it all
You're gonna bust out on it (original prankster)
Break out, yeah (original, yeah)

I tried to save us so many times, but still, you couldn't see
You kept insistin' and resistin' that you would not fall again

And now you're tryna tell me that you're sorry
And you're tryna come back home
You're tellin' me you really need me crying
Beggin' both knees are on the floor
But baby, I

Don't wanna try, don't wanna try, don't wanna try no more
You keep insisting when you know our love is out the door
Don't wanna try, don't wanna try 'cause all we do is fight
And say the things that hurt too bad to where we both begin to cry

Every day
I see her friends talking 'bout me
But I know
There's something there that no one can see

It reminds me of Romeo and Juliet
Like we're living on a movie set
Montague and Capulet, make your daddy sweat
'Cause he wishes we had never met

She says that I just make her world go 'round
God knows I feel it too
I'm so in love, I'm so in love
I'm so in love with you

And that war song is playing, why can't we be friends?

Gotta live my dream my own way

Work, work it harder
Gotta take it farther
No holding back
You know we gotta do it right now

Be even better
Work, work together

Abandoned to fate with no chance of return

Ya' gotta give a little something to a cold dog cat,
Finding him a woman who can shake like that

Hottie, She's a Hottie; got a smokin' little body
String bikini and a barbed-wire tat
She's a-rockin' that cowboy hat
Hottie, She's a Hottie; and just a little bit naughty
Ki yi diggy diggy, ki yi diggy diggy, yey hey hey hey hey

Another chance to get burned, and

I wanna show you but there's nowhere we can really be free
Everybody's watchin'

Wouldn't it be good if we could be together

Take me away
Take me far away from here
I will run with you
Don't be afraid
Navigate and I will steer
Into the sun, we will run

I try to remember when I was just a child
In my room

She's in the kitchen at the crack of dawn
Bacon's on, coffee's strong
Kids running wild, taking off their clothes
If she's a nervous wreck, well it never shows
Takes one to football and one to dance
Hits the Y for aerobics class
Drops by the bank, stops at the store
Has on a smile when I walk through the door
The last to go to bed, she'll be the first one up
And I thought I was tough

She's strong, pushes on, can't slow her down

And say uh uh it looks just right

Well thats the truth about men
Thats the truth about us
We like to hunt, and golf on our days off
And scratch and spit and cuss
And no matter what line we hand you

Down we plunge to the prison of my mind
Down that path into darkness deep as hell

Why you ask, was I bound and chained in this cold and dismal place?
Not for any mortal sin, but the wickedness of my abhorrent face!

Track down this murderer, he must be found!
Track down this murderer, he must be found!

Hounded out by everyone
Met with hatred everywhere
No kind word from anyone
No compassion anywhere

Christine
Why, why?

Your hand at the level of your eyes
At the level of your eyes
(At the level of your eyes)
(At the level of your eyes)

Have you gorged yourself, at last, in your lust for blood?
Am I now to be prey to your lust for flesh?
That fate which condemns me to wallow in blood
Has also denied me the joys of the flesh
This face, the infection which poisons our love
This face, which earned a mother's fear and loathing
A mask, my first unfeeling scrap of clothing
Pity comes too late, turn around and face your fate
An eternity of this before your eyes

This haunted face holds no horror for me now
It's in your soul that the true distortion lies

Wait! I think, my dear, we have a guest
Sir, this is indeed an unparalleled delight
I had rather hoped that you would come
And now my wish comes true
You have truly made my night!

Free her!
Do what you like only free her!
Have you no pity?

Killing time 'til my very own death

In the smoke, in the mud and lead
Smell the fear and the feeling of dread
Soon be time to go over the wall
Rapid fire and end of us all

Whistles, shouts and more gun fire
Lifeless bodies hang on barbed wire
Battlefield nothing but a bloody tomb
Be reunited with my dead friends soon

Drown in mud, no more tears
Surely a war no one can win

See if you're dancing when water is everywhere.
Anguish is endless, but death's unambiguous.
Wave as it carries him off.
Pose while it fits you in hospital gowns, or flirt with the men dressed in white.
Slip into bed with the fire that consumes your house.
Sing on your surveillance tape.
Smile in your autopsy photo for once.
Phone up the boys that have buried your bones.
Where do you get off loving life?
As if it's done any of us any good.

Oh, you're going to wish you were me when the unsuspecting are dragged to their graves.
And you're standing on the edge holding a rose.

Into the sky
Do you think time
Would pass me by?
Cause you know I'd walk a thousand miles
If I could just see you
Tonight

It's always times like these
When I think of you

On vibrate so your phone don't ever ring

Wish we could switch up the roles and I could be that
Tell you I love you, but when you call, I never get back
Would you ask them questions like me, like where you be at?
'Cause I'm out, four in the morning on the corner, rolling, doing my own thing

What if I, had a thing on the side
Made you cry?
Would the rules change up, or would they still apply?
If I played you like a toy
Sometimes I wish I could act like a boy

Can't be getting mad, what you mad?
Can't handle that
Can't be getting mad, what you mad?

Go run the streets (just like 'em)

Massacred innocence, evil took place
The angels were burning inside

Centuries later I wonder why
What secret that they took to their grave
Still burning heretics under our skies
Religion's still burning inside

At the gates and the walls of Montségur
Blood on the stones of the citadel

The innocents died for the pope on his throne
Catholic greed and its paranoid zeal
Curse of the grail and the blood of the cross

Templar believers with blood on their hands

Feelin' damn near ten feet tall
Here she comes, Lord help us all
Ol' T.W.'s girlfriend done slapped him out his chair
Poor ole boy, it ain't his fault
It's so hard not to stare

At that honky tonk badonkadonk
Keepin' perfect rhythm, make ya wanna swing along
Got it goin' on like Donkey Kong
And whoo-wee, shut my mouth, slap your grandma
There oughta be a law, get the Sheriff on the phone
Lord have mercy, how'd she even get them britches on

Well, at first I didn't know, but now it's clear to me
You would cheat with all your freaks and lie compulsively
So I packed up my Louis Vuitton
Jumped in your ride and took off

The blameless are left in complete shackled isolation left to linger and ultimately wither and rot.
Fraudulent peacemakers withdraw any sense of morality to plant the seeds of their own sadistic conceptions.

Take the wrong or righteous road?

There's a thin line between love and hate
Wider divide that you can see between good and bad
There's a grey place between black and white
But everyone does have the right to choose the path that he takes

On society these things

To smoke rings in the dark

Takes a heavy toll
'Cause it burns as slow as whiskey
Through an empty achin' soul

Turning over TV stations
Situations running through my head

Looking back through time
You know it's clear that I've been blind, I've been a fool

To open up my heart to all that jealousy
That bitterness, that ridicule

Saturday, I'm running wild
And all the lights are changing, red to green

Moving through the crowds
I'm pushing chemicals all rushing in my bloodstream

I only wish that you were here
You know I'm seeing it so clear
I've been afraid
To show you how I really feel
Admit to some of those bad mistakes I've made

And if you want it
Come and get it
Crying out loud

Time Turns a Wheel and Love Collides

So Shine while you have the chance to shine

Every moment lasts forever when you feel you've lost your way
What if my chances are already gone

To fight and never walk away

So here I am — still holding on!

With every step you climb another mountain
Every breath it's harder to believe
You'll make it through the pain
Weather the hurricanes
To get to that one thing

Just when you think the road is going nowhere
Just when you've almost gave up on your dreams
Then take it by the hand and show you that you can
There are no boundaries

We sang, we laughed
They all watched us dance
They circled around us
And toasted to forever
We played to win
We never gave in

Learned that happiness on Earth
Ain't just for high achievers (I heard)
I've come to know there's life at both ends

Could stay a while

In your eyes like my first time

Just stay with me, lay with me now

Losing control, feeling the force from the back to the stage
Caught in the spell, 'cause it's louder than hell, gone past the pressures of
Pain
Leather 'n spikes strapped to the wrists of this Metal brigade
Like pistons pumping, headbangers pounding, the sound of an army in rage

Jews killing Muslims, and Christians killing Jews.
The circle is unending, and all sides always lose.
If faith is blind devotion, then death is the result.

When history is rotten
The young young and pure grow dead and cold.
I don't need a book for saving, fellowship or days of praying.
Organizing means dilution, and results in persecution.

Through it all I keep a vision, understand what I believe in.

See I was drinking while I was driving

Never thinking 'bout what I was doing
I turned around and before I knew it
Here comes this truck now

The doctor said ""I dont think he's gonna to make it""
Family said ""make the funeral arrangements""
Unplug the machine he's gone now
Then told my wife to be strong now
Then a small voice said unto me
If you promise to stop drinking
I surrendered on that day
And now for ten years I've been straight

Gave me a second chance, you saved me (thank you Jesus)

Struggling to eat but still there was no answer (no answer)

You got the Prada boots on suede hitting your thigh
Acting like my chrome twenties ain't catching your eye
Sometimes I slow down catch the ass in the mirror
Turn the fog lights on to see the legs more clearer
You're turning me on, keep me standing up
I wish that I could prove to you that I'm man enough
I come up to your job and handcuff your boss
Throw that nigga in the closet and turn the lights off
Then sit you up on the copy machine
Make copies of your kitten with my chin in between
Then I'll take you to the window so the world can see
Baby I'm down on my knees let your world be free
Pearl tongue, come get up on this desk with me
Multiple orgasms is your destiny
Wet dream, ride like you're going to Queens
Like I just gave you fifty thou and ya just turned 18
To hell with your boss
Let that nigga hear you scream
Sounding like that screech on the fax machine
Then we can take it to the ladies bathroom
Make your mascara run till you look like a racoon
Touch yourself baby tell me it's wet
Squeeze tight so I'll never forget, here we go

Make you leave you girl

Starting over, it's so hard
Seems like everywhere I try to go
I keep thinking of you

I just had a wake-up call (call)
Wishing that I never let you fall (fall)
Baby, you are not to blame at all
When I'm the one that pushed you away
Baby, if you knew I cared (cared)
You'd have never went nowhere (nowhere)
Girl, I should've been right there

How do I breathe
Without you here by my side?
How will I see
When your love brought me to the light?
Where do I go
When your heart's where I lay my head?
When you're not with me
How do I breathe?

And when I'm walking a dark road
At night or strolling through the park

When the light begins to change
I sometimes feel a little strange
A little anxious when it's dark

Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have a constant fear that somethings always near
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have a phobia that someone's always there

Have you run your fingers down the wall
And have you felt your neck skin crawl
When you're searching for the light?

Sometimes when you're scared to take a look
At the corner of the room
You've sensed that somethings watching you

One that tells of glory, and wipes away the lies
And to the skies I'd throw it, the stars would do the telling
The moon would help with spelling, and night would dot the 'I's

It's not what you're saying, it's all the stuff you're not saying.

You really are demonstrating a whopping great ego, my friend.
Now keep that? of you
That sort of big-headedness can be a right turn-off!
Now if no one do the job, fair enough, I'm gonna take that and believe in it.
And considering what I know about your damn outrageousness of what's going on inside your head,
Whatever stinking thoughts you're having, we can go without!

This that hustler music
Young Wezzy got that motherfucking hustler music
So ride to it y'all, vibe to it y'all, damn

Goddamn, Mix done hit a nigga in his head with this one
I'ma paint the city red with this one
I'm ahead with this one, see you fucking with the boy
Who tote toys way before Christmas, no assistance, just
That persistence, with that commitment, if
I don't get it, somebody gon' die tonight
I know my vibe is tight, and I deserve the throne
And if the kid ain't right, then let me die in this song

See I be riding, just riding alone
With my daddy on my mind, like, ""You gotta be kidding""
How the hell you ain't here to see your prince do his thing?
Sometimes I wanna drop a tear but no emotions from a king
Shall be, so I be, who I be, that's me
That's Weezy F Baby, and please say the motherfuckin'
So I be, who I be, that's me
That's Weezy F Baby, and please say the motherfuckin'

Baby, you gotta know that I'm just out here
Doing what I gotta do for me and you
And we eating, so, bitch, why the fuck is you tripping?
I'm taking these chances
My head to the sky, my feet on the ground
My fingers to the judge, if the money don't move
Then I won't budge, won't budge
No, I won't budge, no, Lord

Money is the motivation, facing the avenue
Back touching the wall, got the weed, got the gun

All the wind blows and the angels sing

Listenin' to rap metal
Turntables in her eyes

Screamin' someone shoot me

On that September day?
Were you in the yard with your wife and children
Or working on some stage in LA?

Did you stand there in shock at the site of that black smoke
Rising against that blue sky?
Did you shout out in anger, in fear for your neighbor
Or did you just sit down and cry?

Did you weep for the children who lost their dear loved ones
Pray for the ones who don't know?
Did you rejoice for the people who walked from the rubble
And sob for the ones left below?

Did you burst out in pride, for the red, white and blue
And the heroes who died just doing what they do?
Did you look up to heaven for some kind of answer
And look at yourself and what really matters?

I'm just a singer of simple songs
I'm not a real political man
I watch CNN but I'm not sure I can tell you
The difference in Iraq and Iran
But I know Jesus, and I talk to God

When she said that she was unhappily married with children

And I wish I never met her at all
Even though I love her so
But she got love from me

But she still belongs to someone else

It hurts so bad for sure

Wanna be together but the world tryna take us
In different directions and ain't even tell us the choices, the blessins collected
But hold on now wait a second, caught up in my recollection
I remember that body you flexin
Baby me and you was all night sexin
Your boy put it down, didn't he?
You told me you'd never forget
First time that you let me hit, got on top of it and just rode it rode it
All night long (Ha), shoulda been all life long
Me and you cheatin, won't right no wrongs
But, with a good memory, we'll stay strong

I still never met nuttin like you

Sacred weapons to the sacred revealed
To be unleashed upon this council of hell

Where a horrible curse taints the woodlands nearby
With the forms of the walking dead

I'm trying so hard not to get caught up now
But you're just so cool, run your hands through your hair
Absentmindedly makin' me want you

And I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me headfirst, fearless
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance

The original fire has died and gone
But the riot inside moves on

With a pen in one hand, taking us and drugged on kerosene
84 and five would find us something to believe
Right or wrong with dirty hands on wires
Singing songs in dischord choirs
Screaming in braille, no temptress prize
Could ever yield anything so real

I got a bank account bigger than the law should allow

From their covers to my covers wanna lay with me.
Fame and Fortune still can't find, just a grown man runnin' out of time

Though it seems I have everything
I dont wanna be a lonely fool
All of the women, all the expensive cars, all the money don't amount to you.

Where the stained glass once had cast a godly light upon the fold
But come the Sunday service all the faces now were gray
And they commenced to take donations as the faithful knelt to pray

But on Monday they discovered that the man who'd built the glass
Was the only man in town who could and sadly he had passed
But his father who was ninety said the tools were in the shed
And he'd kindly try and resurrect the window from the dead

The congregation argued, but the wise ones all rejoiced
In the one hand was solution, in the other was no choice

And they gave him all the coins they had collected on their plate

With a sign sayin ""will work for food""
You know the man
You see him every morning
The one you never give your money to
You can sit there with your window rolled up
Wondering when the lights going to turn green
Never knowing what a couple more bucks
In his pocket might mean

What if he's an angel sent here from Heaven
And he's making certain that you're doing your best
To take the time to help one another
Brother are you going to pass that test
You can go on with your day to day
Trying to forget what you saw in his face
Knowing deep down it could have been his saving grace

Too strong to lose

Ah, B2K, Pied Piper

Just copped a Bentley, and it's parked in my garage
A two o'clock appointment made for my massage
And everywhere we go they know just who we are
There they go, it's them ghetto superstars

The latest throwbacks and the ones on my feet
Get off the Benz and them I'm off up in the Jeep
Taking flicks with chicks that look like 'Licia Keys
All of that I'm still missing one thing (whoa)

A girlfriend, girlfriend (everything I've wanted)
I need a girlfriend, girlfriend (yeah, and everything that I)
A girlfriend, girlfriend (whoa, would you be my?)
Would you be my girlfriend, girlfriend?

We hit the mall, buying up all the Nike suits
I'm being pampered while I'm chilling by the pool
From the show to the limo to the club
Hands in the air, showing nothing but some love

I'm losing time in these strange days
But somehow I always know the right things to say

I don't know what time it is
Or who's the one to blame for this
Do what I believe what I can't see
And how do you know which way the wind blows?

Cause I can feel it all around
I'm lost between the sound

There she goes

Bury you deep so far that you can't see

But never love you enough that I'mma live a lie
So three snaps up, three snaps down
Wanna be treated like a king you better wear the crown

Wanna play the boss, guess what
You got to pay the cost, sho'nuff
You wanna wear the pants, guess what
You got to be a man, sho'nuff

Hangin' out with your friends, guess what
Don't watch what time you come in, sho'nuff
Don't wanna pay the bills, guess what
I know somebody who will, sho'nuff, listen

Now we've been shackin' up since '93
I ain't gettin' no younger, I need some guarantee
The best years of my life is what I've given you
Argue, fuss and fight, seems that's all you do

And us goin' to church always in your plans
But come Sunday mornin' you play sick in bed

The part of you that's drifting over me
And when I wake you're, you're never there
But when I sleep you're, you're everywhere
You're everywhere

Just tell me how I got this far
Just tell me why you're here and who you are
'Cause every time I look, you're never there
And every time I sleep, you're always there

'Cause you're everywhere to me
And when I close my eyes, it's you I see
You're everything I know, that makes me believe
I'm not alone
I'm not alone

I recognize the way you make me feel

My grandmother owned a night club on the Arkansas-Oklahoma line.
Momma put me on a Greyhound an' I went to stay with her in the summertime.
I'd box up those empty long-necks and stack 'em in the back and bake a ham.
Then at night she'd let me sneak out of the kitchen and sit in with the band.

Yes, I have sacked some quarterbacks
An' broke my share of bones along the way.

When I'm lying wrapped up in your arms
The whole world just fades away
The only thing I hear is the beating of your heart

'Cause I can feel you breathe
It's washing over me
And suddenly I'm melting into you
There's nothing left to prove
Baby, all we need is just to be
Caught up in the touch
Slow and steady rush

Yeah, he plays just what he feels
Keeps a letter in the pocket of his coat
But he never breaks the seal

Set up in a bar room corner
Playin' for tips and beer
People carryin' on and drinkin'
You gotta strain to hear

I've seen him play on some old cheap guitar
But he could play on pots and pans
You never heard a soul so pure and true
It's flowin' right out of his hands
He can sing sweet as a choir girl
Or he can sing a house on fire
I've seen him callin' up the angels
And use a breeze for a telephone wire

It felt more to me
Like a jail cell
A penitentiary
My time spent there, it only made me see

That I don't ever wanna be like you
I don't wanna do the things you do
I'm never gonna hear the words you say
And I don't ever wanna

I don't ever wanna be you
Don't wanna be just like you

Throw all your hands up
You
Don't wanna be you

Quiet conversation makes me warm

Whispers me to sleep
And wakes me up again
Sometimes i swear i hear her call my name
You wash away the pain
My summer rain
In the middle of the night when i'm alone
I feel her kisses on me even when she's gone
Can't wait 'till she gets home

Whispers me to sleep
