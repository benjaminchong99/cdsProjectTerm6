A little too used to being alone
Another new mom and dad, another school
Another house that'll never be home

He looks up and says with a smile upon his face

It's not where I belong
Windows in rooms that I'm passing through

This is just a stop on the way to where I'm going
I'm not afraid because I know
This is my temporary home

The hammer struck the auction table

Fault lines tremble underneath my glass house

Long enough to call it courage
To live without a lifeline
I bend the definition
Of faith to exonerate my blind eye
Till the sirens sound, I'm safe

Meanwhile, my family's taking shelter
The sparks send the fire down the wire

Blurred images of turbulence converge with hideous permanence
The burns of whispered words
This constant curse endures
Disturbed and rendered purposeless
Assured of abject worthlessness

Ripped from the chrysalis and cast, incomplete, into the abyss
Mocked by the dancing light that scorched my eyes on those black nights
Left lifeless but here I stand amongst snaking shadows, like reaching hands
I am the void, I learn my place within the ugliness of my inner space

You'll never find me, make no mistake
I have nothing left for you to take

And you clawed your way out through my ribcage

Create reflections of my pain

And a 20 every time that I picked up when you called
And a crisp new Benjamin
For when you're here, then gone again
And a dollar every time I was right about you after all

Boy, I'd be rich, head to toe Prada
Benz in the driveway, yacht in the water
Vegas, at the Mandarin, high roller gamblin'
Me and Diddy drippin' diamonds like Marilyn

No, I wouldn't be drownin' in all your IOUs
Every promise you made me would have some real value
'Cause all the little lies rollin' off your lips
Is money fallin' from the sky

Under the stars and on the stripes of a
Beach towel in a Spring Break town

It's playin' in the night air
Through the speakers all night long
Couple kids just livin' that American country love song

In every town, in every place
There's a boy who's tryin' to take a chance and dance
And find a way to runaway with her heart
In the back of an old Ford truck
In the bar just lookin' for luck

The Zanzibar guitar, the wild beating of skins (howling back at you)

Twist top on a Sunkist soda
Your brown hair in the west coast wind

Missing turns cause that's our song

Always having your hand to hold

To follow a dream, didn't really have friends

She was hardly a teen, damn
Living in her room, she barely left
Hated bein' lonely
So she slept
Only got up to study for tests
And honestly she don't really care about the rest
Then, she met a dude
Started going out cause
That's all he wanted to do
He didn't care about her
Just some bottles of booze
He was focused on his last
Never told her the truth
Constantly used
Grades started fading away
She was giving everything
While he would take and take

The type of girl giving out the fake cell phone and name
Big fame, she like cats with big things
Jewels chipped, money clip, phone flip, the six range
I seen her on the Ave, spotted her more than once
Ass so fat that you could see it from the front
She spot me like paparazzi, shot me a glance
In that catwoman stance with the fat booty pants, hot damn!

What's your name love, where you came from?
Neck and wrist laced up, very little make-up
The swims at the Reebok gym tone your frame up
Is sugar and spice the only thing that you made of?
I tried to play it low key, but couldn't keep it down
Asked her to dance and she was like, ""Yo, I'm leaving now""
An hour later, sounds from Jamaica
She sipping Cris straight up, shaking, winding her waist up

Scene 2: my fam throwing the jam
Fareed is on the stand, big things is in the plans
The brother Big Mu makes space for me to move
""Ayo, this my man Mos, baby, let me introduce""
I turned around (Say word!) it was the same pretty bird
Who I had priorly observed trying to play me for the herb

Beer bottles layin' on the kitchen floor
If we take 'em all back we can buy some more
So I doubt we'll go without this afternoon

You better hang on if you're taggin' along
'Cause we'll be doin' this 'til six in the mornin'
Nothin' wrong with goin' all night long
Tough to put the brakes on
Doesn't matter when you'd rather

Get up, and go out
Me and all my friends
We drink up, We fall down
And then we do it all again
Just sittin' around, hangin' out this afternoon

Landlord says I should buy a tent
But he can kiss my ass 'cause I paid the rent
So I doubt he'll kick me out this afternoon
Down on the corner in a seedy bar
Jukebox crankin' out the CCR

Kept on the inside and no sunlight
Sometimes a shadow wins

Say what you wanna say
And let the words fall out
Honestly I wanna see you be brave

De la farce humanitaire aboutiraient au néant

J'aime les images fortes, car je suis comme toi
Le poids des mots et le choc des photos

Hey yo, it's time to get up, time to change the world 'cause I'm fed up
We're gonna expose the wrong that's been going on
There's people dying in the streets still
In every city, lots of kids they be ill
I live in Brooklyn, got boys all over
Been around the world and you know that I know the

Spewed forth in precarious birth

Precious, twisting life
Crawling on the filth of the dumpster floor
Only known to the mother in guilt
As she stumbles from the alley covered in flies

With a ten mile stare dead to the world

Sucks the crack pipe in shame just to forget
Yet with another hit, she's on the streets again
In another life she once had hope

Truth was not always quite what you believed
Trust has made fools out of great men before

We will set you free

Run away, from the lies
From their truth that blinds your eyes
Break the chains, spark the fire in your mind

Sing our song, join the fight
As we stand for what is right
Be the change you want to see today

I know what you're thinking, I know what you say
Nothing you can do but take this away
This hasn't been fun for time out of mind
So you can pack up your crap and you can leave it behind

I know what you're thinking, I know what you say
But no point you could make would hold any sway
All your phony crap can't hold us down

Got my honkytonk attitude from Joe Diffie
Daddy did it too, it's family tradition

And I gotta give props to the radio, 'cause if you know me

She said, ""I don't drink
""But sometimes I need a stiff drink""
""Sippin' from a highball glass""
""Let the world fade away""
She said, ""I don't smoke""
""But sometimes I need a long drag""
""Yeah, I know it might sound bad""
""But sometimes I need a smoke break""

He's a big-city, hard-workin' man just tryna' to climb the ladder
First generation to go to college instead of drivin' a tractor
Never had nothin' handed to him on a silver platter

Whenever I'm pushed against the wall

Blistering my soul but I can't feel

You hear me say, get out of my way
I'll do it my own way
Cross my path and get what you deserve

I'm warning this world
To stay out of my way
My voice will be heard
I'm alone

I won't be afraid
I got something to say
My voice will be heard
So loud, native blood

Forever proud, so goddamn loud
It's me alone against the crowd
Right or wrong it's the road that I must choose

There's no excuse, attitude

He'll learn your face by heart
But you'll be in black and white in his eyes
Playing your part to memorize the lines
In the flick of a feather, he flies to your side

I saw it coming, he won't change his ways
Oh, Mr. Magpie is in it for the thrill of the chase
I saw it coming, should've raised the alarm
Girl, are you gonna be another victim of his charm?

Boy, you're making waves, in the same old way
Times are changing, you're still playing the same old game
Boy, you're making waves, in the same old way

Said seventeen's too young to know what loves about

He brought home sixty-seven bucks a week
He bought a little 2 bedroom house on Maple Street
Where she blessed him with six more mouths to feed
Yea that's crazy

Just ask him how he did it; he'll say pull up a seat
It'll only take a minute, to tell you everything
Be a best friend, tell the truth, and over use I Love You

He threw that gaping brain asunder

And every day that you wake!
Is a gift that you take from the gods!

Here you are, all you fuck with is wages!

Release high through these eyes

Embraces the qi and he praises the weeds!
Holding out for the day he can face them
And every day that he trains is a slap in the face to the gods!
God damn!

Shutting out politics, viewing beings as equals!
Ain't it funny how that makes sense!?
You had the floor but you gave it a bore, now it's equal
Can we clean that slate!?

He is a sucker with a gun, gun, gun, gun

I know you said he's just a dog astray
He is a bad boy with a tainted heart
And even I know this ain't smart

But mama I'm in love with a criminal
And this type of love isn't rational
It's physical
Mama please don't cry, I will be alright
All reasons aside, I just can't deny
Love the guy

He is a killer just for fun, fun, fun, fun

Then one foggy Christmas Eve,
Santa came to say,
Rudolph with your nose so bright,
Won't you guide my sleigh tonight?

Everybody but me could see the punchline coming a mile away
I've heard it so many times I can tell it to the T
Believe me I could sell it all day
It goes

A guy walks into a bar, orders a drink
Sees a girl that catches his eye
Asks her if she wants another
They fall for each other and end up lovers
They laugh, cry, hold on tight, make it work for a little while
Then one night, her taillights fade out into the dark
And a guy walks into a bar

Depression and unemployment
This song's for you
Today's a new day, and there is no sunshine
Nothing but clouds, and it's dark in my heart
And it feels like a cold night
Today's a new day, where are my blue skies
Where is the love and the joy that you promised me
You tell me it's alright
I'll be honest with you

I almost gave up, but a power that I can't explain
Fell from heaven like a shower
(When I think how much better I'm gonna be when this is over)

I smile, even though I'm hurt, see I smile
I know God is working so I smile
Even though I've been here for a while (what do you do?)
I smile, smile (come on)
It's so hard to look up when you look down
I sure would hate to see you give up now (god's people)
You look so much better when you smile, so smile
(Now everyday ain't gon' be perfect
But still don't mean today don't have purpose, c'mon)

Today's a new day, but there is no sunshine
Nothing but clouds, and it's dark in my heart
And it feels like a cold night
Today's a new day, tell me where are my blue skies (where is that love, y'all?)

Grab your passport and my hand
I can make the good girls bad for a weekend

So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames

They'll tell you I'm insane

And you love the game

We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless

No randandan
No ""one for all""
And ""all for one""

They will teach you

My heart still feels pain

When I look at you
Memories of love
Like no one before
You'll stay on my mind

Always so special
(I was yours and you were mine)
Made for each other
(All the good I won't forget)
You will stay on my mind
(Saturday, the day we met)

For always and for ever
You will be my Saturday love

Gonna camp in my sleeping bag, I'm not gonna move

Saying, ""If you see this girl, can you tell her where I am?""

Some try to hand me money, they don't understand
I'm not broke, I'm just a broken-hearted man
I know it makes no sense, what else can I do?
And how can I move on when I'm still in love with you?

'Cause if one day you wake up, and find that you're missing me
And your heart starts to wonder where on this Earth I could be
Thinking maybe you'll come back here to the place that we'd meet
And you'll see me waiting for you, on the corner of the street
So I'm not moving
I'm not moving

And I will do the same.

We may be picking up the pieces here on after,

We are shaped by the light we let through us,

I brought it all up, got it all out
What is it worth to both of us now?

You feel bad, and I feel worse
I swear it's the last time every time
Don't know why

There's something breaking at the brick of every wall
It's holdin' all that you know

Where the runaways are runnin' the night
Impossible comes true, it's takin' over you

You wanted to see me in your future

Many moons that are deep at play, so I
Keep an eye on the shadow's smile to see what it has to say
You and I both know
Everything must go away
A-what do you say?

Spinning off, head is on my heart
It's like a bit of light in a touch of dark you got
Sneak attacked from the zodiac but I see your eyes spark
Keep the breeze and go
Blow by blow and go away
A-what do you say?

Yeah, you don't know my mind, you don't know my kind
Dark necessities are part of my design and

They know when my money show off
I don't ever get it one way, yeah
Spend it and I get it same day, but hey

I didn't come here to party
I didn't come here to stay
I came to leave with somebody
I only came for the cake

And I don't mean to pry, but girl, I gotta know
What is your name?
How come I ain't seen you around before? (Tell me)
You know I ain't ever had a type, having a type takes two
But I know what I like, and you're the only one of you
You're something else (damn)
And I know we just met, but

I wanna introduce you to my kinfolks, to my old friends
To the house in the pines where the road ends
Take you to my hometown, where I grew up
Where I thought I knew it all before I knew what love was
Gave up on it, but honey, you got my hopes up
And I'm thinking that I wanna introduce you to my kinfolks

I shouldnt be crying, tears were for the weak
The days I'm stronger, know what, so I say

Whatever it is, it's just laughing at me
And I just wanna scream

Sometimes you gotta bleed to know
That you're alive and have a soul
But it takes someone to come around
To show you how

She's the tear in my heart
I'm alive
She's the tear in my heart
I'm on fire
She's the tear in my heart
Take me higher
Than I've ever been

The songs on the radio are okay
But my taste in music is your face
And it takes a song to come around
To show you how

She's the tear in my heart
I'm alive
She's the tear in my heart
I'm on fire

I want the world in my hands
I hate the beach but I stand
In California with my toes in the sand
Use the sleeves of my sweater
Let's have an adventure
Head in the clouds but my gravity's centered
Touch my neck and I'll touch yours
You in those little high-waisted shorts, oh

She knows what I think about
And what I think about
One love, two mouths
One love, one house
No shirt, no blouse
Just us, you find out
Nothing that I wouldn't wanna tell you about, no

'Cause it's too cold
For you here and now
So let me hold
Both your hands in the holes of my sweater

And if I may just take your breath away
I don't mind if there's not much to say

I gave it all I could give
I made it hot at the crib
I kept that fire at the crib
Where you gon' go when you dip?
How I'ma know who for real?
I pour a four in a fifth
You already know what it is
I keep a pole in the whip
'Cause a lot of these niggas out here envy me
It ain't no ho in the clique
None of my dawgs got fuckboy tendencies
I don't even show no sympathy
Sipping on Hennessy, it got me bending sideways
Everything on me dripping, you niggas can't ride the wave
Nigga run around with the juice, nigga come spill your drank
I done earn my stripes now I'm tryna go get me some real rank

Reading through my third eye 'cause I got tunnel vision
Had to open my mind, then I opened a Benz
