I Will Follow - Live,U2,irish rock,1987,140,90,23,-7,96,49,239,0,6,42,"I was on the outside when you said
You needed me
I was looking at myself
I was blind, I could not see

A boy tries hard to be a man
His mother takes him by the hand
If he stops to think, he starts to cry
Oh why?

If you walk away, walk away
I walk away, walk away
I will follow.
If you walk away, walk away

Where the river runs high above the rooftops.

From the Dutch mountains.

I was standing in a valley of rock
Up to my belly in an early fog.
I was looking for the road to a green painted house -
In the Dutch mountains.
In the Dutch mountains
- Mountains -.

I met a woman in a valley of stone

She was painting roses on the walls of her home.

Wire in a fire, representing seven games

Left of west and coming in a hurry with the Furies
Breathing down your neck
Team by team, reporters baffled, trumped, tethered, cropped
Look at that low playing, fine, then
Uh-oh, overflow, population, common food
But it'll do, save yourself, serve yourself

Now your conscience is clear

In the morning when I wipe my brow
Wipe the miles away
I like to think I can be so willed
And never do what you say
I'll never hear you
And never do what you say

Look my eyes are just holograms
Look your love has drawn red from my hands
From my hands you know you'll never be

Had his moments of doubt and pain
Made damn sure that Pilate
Washed his hands and sealed his fate

Pleased to meet you
Hope you guess my name, oh yeah
But what's puzzling you
Is the nature of my game

I stuck around St. Petersburg
When I saw it was a time for a change
Killed the Czar and his ministers
Anastasia screamed in vain

I rode a tank, held a General's rank
When the Blitzkrieg raged and the bodies stank

Dreaming of a spark
When I heard the sprinklers whisper
Shimmer in the haze of summer lawns

Then I heard the children singing
They were running through the rainbows
They were singing a song for you
Well it seemed to be a song for you
The one I wanted to write for you, for you, you

Lavenders blue, dilly dilly, lavenders green
When I am king, dilly dilly
You will be queen

Left a good job in the city
Working for the man every night and day
And I never lost one minute of sleeping
Worrying 'bout the way that things might have been

Some nights your carved in ice,

I know you can save me, No one else can save me now but you.

As long as the stars are burning,
As long as your dreams are coming true - You better believe it! -

And I'll be there until the final act -
I would do anything for love!
And I'll take a Vow and Seal a pact -

But I'll never forgive myself if we dont go all the way - Tonight -

I should have made you leave your key

Go on now, go, walk out the door
Just turn around now 'cause you're not welcome anymore

When I was young, me and my mama had beef
17 years old, kicked out on the streets
Though back at the time I never thought I'd see her face
Ain't a woman alive that could take my mama's place
Suspended from school, and scared to go home, I was a fool
With the big boys breakin' all the rules

I shed tears with my baby sister, over the years
We was poorer than the other little kids
And even though we had different daddies, the same drama
When things went wrong we'd blame Mama
I reminisce on the stress I caused, it was hell
Huggin' on my mama from a jail cell

And who'd think in elementary, hey
I'd see the penitentiary one day?
And runnin' from the police, that's right
Mama catch me, put a whoopin' to my backside
And even as a crack fiend, Mama
You always was a black queen, Mama
I finally understand
For a woman it ain't easy tryin' to raise a man

You always was committed
A poor single mother on welfare, tell me how you did it
There's no way I can pay you back
But the plan is to show you that I understand
You are appreciated

You knew I could not resist
I needed someone

And now we're flyin' through the stars
I hope this night will last forever

Loves me better (loves me better)
Makes me happy
Makes me feel this way (nobody)
Ain't nobody (ain't nobody)
Loves me better, than you

I'll cross that bridge when I find it
Another day to make my stand, oh woah
High time is no time for deciding
If I should find a helping hand, oh woah

Buy time, don't lose it

World of Hurt,Ilse DeLange,dutch americana,1998,99,47,87,-10,13,64,234,62,4,40,"Day one God smiled,
Gave us all the wisdom of a newborn child
But by the time we take our first step
We've already begun to forget
What the heart knows the heart sees
We're just as much the forest, as we are the trees
Every little seed trying to find
Where the light comes from
[Chorus]
And it's a world of hurt, nothing works
It's a lonely little planet made of dust and dirt
Who'd ever think that in the midst of all this
Something as beautiful as love exists
And when I hold you, and you hold me
Heaven doesn't seem like such a mystery
Darling in a world of hurt
You make me feel so good
Day one of our love,
Two heartbroken people scared to trust too much
