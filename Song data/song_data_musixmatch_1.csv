Now time for me is nothin' cuz I'm countin' no age
Naw I couldn't be there, now you shouldn't be scared
I'm good at repairs (s'all simple), and I'm under each snare
Intangible (aww dawg), bet you didn't think so I command you to
Panoramic view (you),
Look I'll make it all manageable
Pick and choose (hmph),
Sit and loose,
All you different crews.
Chicks and dudes,
So who you think is really kickin' tunes?
Picture you gettin down in tha picture tube,
Like you lit the fuse
You think it's fictional?
Mystical? maybe
Spiritual?
Hero who appears in you ta clear your view (yeah) but your too crazy

Keep you in the dark

Send in your skeletons
Sing as their bones go marching in again
They need you buried deep
The secrets that you keep are ever ready
Are you ready?

I'm finished making sense
Done pleading ignorance
That whole defense

Spinning infinity, boy
The wheel is spinning me
It's never-ending, never-ending
Same old story

What if I say I'm not like the others?
What if I say I'm not just another one of your plays?
You're the pretender
What if I say I will never surrender?

What if I say I'm not like the others?

The dream has flown away
And fear is not here to stay

I don't mind spending everyday
Out on your corner in the pouring rain
Look for the girl with the broken smile
Ask her if she wants to stay awhile

The best you ever had is just a memory
And those dreams weren't as daft as they seem

Remember when the boys were all electric?
Now when she's told she's gonna get it

Look beyond the cracks that store away
It's hidden in the windows of the walls
Right behind the eyes that saw it all

Now given all the facts of circumstance
I did not believe that a romance
Would show itself in all this dark and blue
That's the only place I ever knew
You put me outside my safety-zone
Outside all the lines that made my home
To find out that no one really lives
Without giving what it is you give

My dirty hands, have I been in the wars?
The saddest thing that I'd ever seen
Were smokers outside the hospital doors

Someone turn me around
Can I start this again?

And if I give it a twist
Something to hold when I lose my grip

Will I find something in that?

So damn ugly, so damn cute
So well trained, so animal

You touched my heart, you touched my soul
Changed my life and all my goals
And love is blind, and that I knew when
My heart was blinded by you

I've kissed your lips and held your head
Shared your dreams and shared your bed

I've been addicted to you

They hang on every word you speak, yes they do.

When you're alone in your bed
Tell me the thoughts that surround you

Put your house up on for sale, did you get a good lawyer?

To explain in due time

All I know
Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away

It's so unreal
Didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Tryin' to hold on, did-didn't even know

I kept everything inside and even though I tried
It all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually
Be a memory of a time when-

You stare politely right on through

Some sort of window to your right
As he goes left, and you stay right
Between the lines of fear and blame
You begin to wonder why you came

Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

Let him know that you know best
'Cause after all, you do know best
Try to slip past his defense
Without granting innocence

Lay down a list of what is wrong
The things you've told him all along

The night keeps on closing in on the day
A nightingale sings his song of farewell
You better hide for her freezing hell

On cold wings, she's coming
You better keep moving
For warmth, you'll be longing
Come on, just feel it
Don't you see it?
You better believe

When she embraces, your heart turns to stone
She comes at night when you're all alone

A veil over the light
In the distance some shadows of the clouds in the sky
I've got to get home
To my child, my wife

Here comes the night
I'm scared to death
Got to get me a ride
It looks like the road is swallowing me up
Gotta hurry home
Don't dare to look back
Blueville is straight ahead

Another 45 miles to go
Another 45 miles before I'm home
I wish that the sunlight was burning in my eyes

Is all we have to give these -

Future's made of virtual insanity now
Always seem to, be governed by this love we have

Burn so bright, I wonder what the wave meant
White heat is screaming in the jungle
Complete the motion if you stumble
Go ask the dust for any answers
Come back strong with 50 belly dancers

To be part of the wave, can't stop
Ever wonder if it's all for you?
The world I love, the trains I hop
To be part of the wave, can't stop

Sweetheart is bleeding in the snow cone
So smart, she's leading me to ozone
Music the great communicator

And are we out of sight?
Or will our world come tumbling down?
Will they find our hiding place?
Is this our last embrace?
Or will the walls start caving in?

(It could be wrong, could be wrong) To let our hearts ignite
(It could be wrong, could be wrong) Are we digging a hole?

Many the lives we lived in each day

Don't look away

And legs of stone
You will knock on my door

In white light

I wish nothing but the best for you both
An older version of me, is she perverted like me?
Would she go down on you in a theatre?
Does she speak eloquently? And would she have your baby
I'm sure she'd make a really excellent mother

'Cause the love that you gave that we made
Wasn't able to make it enough for you to be open wide, no
And every time you speak her name
Does she know how you told me you'd hold me until you died
'Til you died, but you're still alive

And I'm here, to remind you
Of the mess you left when you went away
It's not fair, to deny me
Of the cross I bear that you gave to me
You, you, you oughta know

Haunt my mind

I just know there's no escape now
Once it sets it's eyes on you
But I won't run, have to stare it in the eyes

Stand my ground, I won't give in
No more denying
I've gotta face it

Won't close my eyes
And hide the truth inside
If I don't make it
Someone else will

Through the country, rivers so pretty
People wonder why I'm going back home
Just the place where I belong

Back home,
Back home,
Back home,
Back home
Well I'm a round the world rambler

Times Are Changing,DI-RECT,dutch indie,2010,123,81,50,-6,15,28,206,4,4,47,"Everybody is in a separate zone
All together but we're so alone.
Staring out through a wall of glass,
Look away because it's gonna crash.

And ooh...
My hart is open
Ooh, the times are changing

Forever
Forever

Need You Now,Lady Antebellum,contemporary country,2010,108,72,58,-4,24,32,236,3,3,53,"Picture perfect memories
Scattered all around the floor
Reaching for the phone cause
I can't fight it anymore

And I wonder if I ever cross your mind
For me it happens all the time

It's a quarter after one
I'm all alone and I need you now
Said I wouldn't call, but I lost all control
And I need you now
And I don't know how I can do without
I just need you now

I didn't mean to end his life
I know it wasn't right
I can't even sleep at night
Can't get it off my mind
I need to get out of sight
Before I end up behind bars

What started out as a simple altercation
Turned into a real sticky situation
Me just thinking on the time that I'm facing
Makes me wanna cry

'Cause I didn't mean to hurt him
Could've been somebody's son
And I took his heart when
I pulled out that gun

Rum-pum-pum-pum
Rum-pum-pum-pum
Rum-pum-pum-pum
Man down

Rum-pum-pum-pum
Rum-pum-pum-pum
Rum-pum-pum-pum
Man down

Oh, mama, mama, mama
I just shot a man down
In central station
In front of a big old crowd
Oh why, oh why?

Oh, mama, mama, mama
I just shot a man down
In central station

It's a 22, I call her Peggy Sue

Roaring down the mountain, now they're calling on the fire brigade
Bury out the pictures and tell the kids that I'm okay

If and I'm forgotten, you'll remember me for the day

I, I won't ever be your corner stone

We're gonna spit on the rivals
All I wanna know is how far you wanna go
Fighting for survival

Underneath the stars, where we parked the cars
Ain't showing signs of stopping
Pretty little girls, naked to their curls
Ready to lay in a coffin

If you wanna go, I'm gonna go
I've got a fire burning
Go on, take my hand when we see the band
Baby's gonna be a big one, oh, yeah

Riverside,Agnes Obel,chamber pop,2010,99,19,65,-14,13,23,231,98,3,48,"Down by the river by the boat
Where everybody goes to be alone
Where you won't see any rising sun
Down to the river we will run

When by the water we drink to the dregs
Look at the stones on the riverbed
I can tell from your eyes
You've never been by the riverside

Down by the water, the riverbed
Somebody calls you, somebody says
""Swim with the current and float away""
Down by the river everyday
