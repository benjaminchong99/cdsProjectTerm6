And a long memory
I been searching for an answer
Always just out of reach

Blood on the floor
Sirens repeat
I been searching for the courage
To face my enemies
When they turn down the lights

I hear my battle symphony
All the world in front of me
If my armor breaks
I'll fuse it back together
Battle symphony
Please just don't give up on me
And my eyes are wide awake

She says it must be youth
That keeps us feeling strong
I see it in her face, that's turned to ice
And when she smiles she shows the lines of sacrifice

And now I know what they're saying
'Cause our sun begins to fade
And we made our love on wasteland
And through the barricades

Father made my history
He fought for what he thought
Would set us somehow free

He taught me what to say in school
I learned it off by heart
But now that's torn in two

Else I've got to be

Take back your

Sometimes the clothes

Is take these lies and
Make them true somehow

Is that I don't belong to you

Belong to me yeah, yeah

Travel through the night 'cause there is no fear
Alone but right behind, until I watched you disappear

Of a long black night
Just moving with the moon
And the light it shines
And I'm thinking of a place
And it feels so very real
Just moving through the dark

To the hip hip hop, you don't stop
The rockin' to the bang bang boogie say up jumps the boogie
To the rhythm of the boogity beat

Now what you hear is not a test, I'm rappin' to the beat
And me, the groove, and my friends, are gonna try to move your feet
You see, I am Wonder Mike, and I'd like to say hello
To the black, to the white, the red, and the brown, the purple and yellow
But first, I gotta bang bang the boogie to the boogie
Say up jump the boogie to the bang bang boogie
Let's rock, you don't stop
Rock the rhythm that will make your body rock

Well, so far you've heard my voice, but I brought two friends along
And next on the mic is my man Hank
Come on, Hank, sing that song

Check it out, I'm the C-A-S-AN-the-O-V-A
And the rest is F-L-Y
You see I go by the code of the doctor of the mix
And these reasons I'll tell ya why
You see I'm six foot one and I'm tons of fun
And I dress to a 'T'
You see I got more clothes than Muhammad Ali
And I dress so viciously

I got bodyguards, I got two big cars
That definitely ain't the whack
I got a Lincoln Continental and a sunroof Cadillac
So after school, I take a dip in the pool, which really is on the wall
I got a color TV so I can see the Knicks play basketball
Hear me talkin' 'bout checkbooks, credit cards
More money than a sucker could ever spend
But I wouldn't give a sucker or a bum from the rucker
Not a dime 'til I made it again

Everybody go hotel, motel, whatcha gonna do today? (say what?)
Ya say I'm gonna get a fly girl gonna get some spankin'
Drive off in a def O.J.
Everybody go, hotel, motel, Holiday Inn
Say if your girl starts actin' up, then you take her friend
Master Gee, am I mellow?
It's on you, so what you gonna do?

Well it's on an' on an' on on an' on
The beat don't stop until the break of dawn
I said M-A-S, T-E-R, a G with a double E
I said I go by the unforgettable name of the man they call the Master Gee
Well, my name is known all over the world by all the foxy ladies and the pretty girls
I'm goin' down in history as the baddest rapper there ever could be

Now I'm feelin' the highs and you're feelin' the lows
The beat starts gettin' into your toes
Ya start poppin' ya fingers and stompin' your feet
And movin' your body while you're sittin' in your seat
And then damn, you start doin' the freak
I said damn, right outta your seat
Then ya throw your hands high in the air
Ya rockin' to the rhythm, shake your derriere
Ya rockin' to the beat without a care
With the sureshot MCs for the affair

Now, I'm not as tall as the rest of the gang
But I rap to the beat just the same
I got a little face and a pair of brown eyes
All I'm here to do ladies is hypnotize
Singin' on an' an' on an' on an' on
The beat don't stop until the break of dawn
Singin' on n n on n on on n on
Like a hot buttered a pop da pop da pop dibbie dibbie
Pop da pop pop ya don't dare stop
Come alive y'all, gimme what ya got

I guess by now you can take a hunch
And find that I am the baby of the bunch
But that's okay, I still keep in stride
'Cause all I'm here to do is just wiggle your behind
Singin' on an' an' on an' on an' on
The beat don't stop until the break of dawn
Singin' on an' an' on an' on on an' on
Rock, rock y'all, throw it on the floor

I'm gonna freak ya here, I'm gonna freak ya there
I'm gonna move you outta this atmosphere
'Cause I'm one of a kind and I'll shock your mind
I'll put t-t-tickets in your behind
I said 1-2-3-4, come on girls, get on the floor
A-come alive y'all, a-gimme what ya got
'Cause I'm guaranteed to make you rock
I said 1-2-3-4, tell me Wonder Mike what are you waitin' for?

I said a hip hop the hippie to the hippie
The hip hip hop, a you don't stop
The rockin' to the bang bang boogie say up jumped the boogie
To the rhythm of the boogity beat
Skiddlee beebop we rock a Scoobie-Doo
And guess what America we love you
Cause ya rock and ya roll with so much soul
You could rock till you're a hundred and one years old
I don't mean to brag i don't mean to boast
But we like hot butter on our breakfast toast
Rock it up baby bubba
Baby bubba to the boogie da bang bang da boogie
To the beat beat, its so unique
Come on everybody and dance to the beat

I said a hip hop the hippie the hippie
To the hip hip hop, a-you don't stop
Rock it out, pretty bubba to the boogity bang, bang,
The boogie to the boogity beat

I said I cant wait 'til the end of the week
When I'm rappin' to the rhythm of a groovy beat
And attempt to raise your body heat
Just blow your mind so that you can't speak
And do a thing but a-rock and shuffle your feet
And let it change up to a dance called the freak
And when you finally do come in to your rhythmic beat
Rest a little while so ya don't get weak
I know a man named Hank

High on life 'til the day we die

Burning in your eyes
You look at me and babe, I wanna catch on fire

Like California gold
You found the light in me that I couldn't find

So when I'm all choked up, but I can't find the words
Every time we say goodbye, baby, it hurts
When the sun goes down
And the band won't play
I'll always remember us this way

Lovers in the night
Poets trying to write

I've really been the best, the best of fools
I did what I could
'Cause I love you, baby
How I love you, darling
How I love you, baby
My beloved little girl, little girl

I'm about to lose my worried mind, ah yeah

Everybody tryna tell me
That you didn't mean me no good
I've been trying

We sang every song that driver knew.

Freedom is just another word for nothing left to lose,
Nothing don't mean nothing honey if it ain't free, now now.

Good enough for me and my Bobby McGee.

There's a voice in my head that drives my heel
It's my baby callin', sayin', ""I need you here""
And it's a half past four and I'm shiftin' gear

When she is lonely and the longing gets too much
She sends a cable, coming in from above
Don't need no phone at all

We've got a thing that's called radar love
We've got a wave in the air
Radar love

The radio's playin' some forgotten song
Brenda Lee's ""Coming On Strong""

You're my sunshine

That my feelings are true
I really love you

In the days when lands were few

Into the blue and sunny morn'

And the night followed day

For many a lonely day
Sailed across the milky seas
Never looked back, never feared, never cried

50 Ways to Leave Your Lover,Paul Simon,classic rock,1975,102,37,82,-13,8,29,217,17,8,69,"The problem is all inside your head, she said to me
The answer is easy if you take it logically
I'd like to help you in your struggle to be free
There must be fifty ways to leave your lover

She said, it's really not my habit to intrude
Furthermore, I hope my meaning won't be lost or misconstrued
But I'll repeat myself at the risk of being crude
There must be fifty ways to leave your lover
Fifty ways to leave your lover

You just slip out the back, Jack
Make a new plan, Stan
You don't need to be coy, Roy
Just get yourself free
Hop on the bus, Gus
You don't need to discuss much
Just drop off the key, Lee
And get yourself free

That love was meant for beauty queens
And high school girls with clear skinned smiles
Who married young and then retired

The valentines I never knew
The friday night charades of youth
Were spent on one more beautiful
At seventeen I learned the truth

And those of us with ravaged faces
Lacking in the social graces
Desperately remained at home
Inventing lovers on the phone

Who called to say come dance with me
And murmured vague obscenities
It isn't all it seems
At seventeen

You know I've always been a dreamer
Spent my life running 'round
And it's so hard to change
Can't seem to settle down

But the dreams I've seen lately
Keep on turning out and burning out
And turning out the same

So put me on a highway
And show me a sign
And take it to the limit
One more time

You can spend all your time making money
You can spend all your love making time
If it all fell to pieces tomorrow
Would you still be mine?

Where the old world shadows hang
Heavy in the air
She packed her hopes and dreams
Like a refugee
Just as her father came across the sea

She heard about a place people were smilin'
They spoke about the red man's way
And how they loved the land
And they came from everywhere
To the Great Divide
Seeking a place to stand
Or a place to hide

Down in the crowded bars
Out for a good time
Can't wait to tell you all
What it's like up there
And they called it paradise

Enter Patty Valentine from the upper hall
She sees the bartender in a pool of blood
Cries out, ""My God, they've killed them all!""

Here comes the story of the Hurricane
The man the authorities came to blame
For somethin' that he never done
Put in a prison cell, but one time he could-a been
The champion of the world

Three bodies lyin' there does Patty see
And another man named Bello, movin' around mysteriously
""I didn't do it,"" he says, and he throws up his hands
""I was only robbin' the register, I hope you understand""

""I saw them leavin',"" he says, and he stops
""One of us had better call up the cops""
And so Patty calls the cops
And they arrive on the scene
With their red lights flashin' in the hot New Jersey night

Meanwhile, far away in another part of town
Rubin Carter and a couple of friends are drivin' around
Number one contender for the middleweight crown
Had no idea what kinda shit was about to go down

When a cop pulled him over to the side of the road
Just like the time before and the time before that
In Paterson that's just the way things go
If you're black you might as well not show up on the street
'Less you wanna draw the heat

Alfred Bello had a partner and he had a rap for the cops
Him and Arthur Dexter Bradley were just out prowlin' around
He said, ""I saw two men runnin' out, they looked like middleweights
They jumped into a white car with out-of-state plates""

And Miss Patty Valentine just nodded her head
Cop said, ""Wait a minute, boys, this one's not dead""

See how the sun shines brightly in the city

You had to hide away for so long (so long)

We shall defend our island

How great the fall can be

While everybody's sleeping
The boat's put out to sea
Born on the wings of time
It seems the answers
Were so easy to find
Too late the prophets cry

The island's sinking

Next up for bids in the rear of the room
A piano worn down and a bit out of tune
Who'll start the bidding, the auctioneer cried
No voices rang out, so just put it aside
Shouts filled the room and the auction went on
When the cries of the crowd were stopped by a song
Everyone turned to the rear of the room
To that worn down piano, a bit out of tune
Oh the days long ago when the crowds came around
To hear that piano ring out with sound
But the crowds have all gone and the symphony's through
And the piano cries out: 'let me play once for you'

Got a good job, got a good office
Got a new wife, got a new life
And the family's fine
We lost touch long ago
You lost weight I did not know
You could ever look so good after
So much time.

I remember those days hanging out
At the village green
Engineer boots, leather jackets
And tight blue jeans
Drop a dime in the box play the
Song about New Orleans
Cold beer, hot lights

Brenda and Eddie were the
Popular steadys
And the king and the queen
Of the prom

All of the days and nights that we know will be
I will stay with you, will you stay with me?
Just one single tear in each passing year

Bet you're sittin' drinkin' coffee, yawnin' sleepily

Time has changed your point of view

How you gonna see me now
Please don't see me ugly babe
'Cause I know I let you down
In oh so many ways
How you gonna see me now
Since we've been on our own
Are you gonna love the man
When the man gets home

Listen darlin' now I'm heading for the west
Straightened out my head but my old heart is still a mess

But I have to have things my own way

Like a ship without an anchor, like a slave without a chain
Just the thought of those sweet ladies sends a shiver through my veins
And I will go on shining, shining like brand new
I'll never look behind me, my troubles will be few

Goodbye stranger, it's been nice
Hope you'll find your paradise
Tried to see your point of view
Hope your dreams will all come true

Come tomorrow, feel no pain

Another one bites the dust
Yo, hold your breath, and another one gone, hold your breath, and another gone
Hold your breath, another one bites the dust, yo, check it
If you're a soldier at ease
My military style is known to murder Nazi's, Brooklyn to Germany (ohhh, yeah)
My kamikaze will blow the U2, they hire Idi Amin in Timbuktu
Whether you indo, or do the Voodoo
You can't foresee this unless I bring the previews, yeah, yeah
Yo, it's the number one rappin' band, come on
Yo, this review will be critically acclaimed
Leave you in critical pain, clinically insane

Ooh, to ease my mind
And I need to find time
Someone to call mine
My mama said

You can't hurry love
No, you'll just have to wait
She said love don't come easy
But it's a game of give and take

You can't hurry love
No, you'll just have to wait
Just trust in a good time
No matter how long it takes

Oh how many heartaches must I stand
Before I find new love to let me live again
Right now, the only thing that keeps me hangin' on
When I feel my strength, ooh, it's almost gone
I remember mama said

You can't hurry love
No, you'll just have to wait

Run away and hide from everyone
Can you change the things we've said and done?

Because it's not my home, it's their home
And I'm welcome no more

And if a double-decker bus
Crashes into us
To die by your side

So the pound has dropped
And the children are creating

Taking all the cash and leaving you with the lumber

Got a pain in the chest
Doctor's on strike
What you need is a rest
It's not easy, love
But you've got friends you can trust

Friends will be friends
When you're in need of love
They give you care and attention
Friends will be friends
When you're through with life and all hope is lost
Hold out your hand 'cause friends will be friends
Right 'til the end

And this emptiness fills my heart
When I want to run away
I drive off in my car

But whichever way I go
I come back to the place you are
All my instincts
They return

The grand façade
So soon will burn
Without a noise

Without my pride
I reach out from the inside
In your eyes
The light, the heat
I am complete
I see the doorway
To a thousand churches

Hope I live to tell the secret I have learned till then it will burn inside of me

I've seen it once
I know the warmth she gives
The light that you could never see
It shines inside you can't take that from me...

Running down underground
To a dive bar in a West End town

Faces on posters, too many choices
